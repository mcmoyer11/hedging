3:33	Uh , first , um , I need *-1 to know , uh , how do you feel *T*-2 \[ about , \+ uh , about \] * sending , uh , an elderly , uh , family member to a nursing home ? E_S
5:39	Well , of course , \[ it 's , \+ you know , it 's \] one of the last few things in the world 0 you 'd ever want *-1 to do *T*-2 , you know . Unless it 's just , you know , really , you know , and , uh , \[ for their , \+ uh , you know , for their \] own good . E_S

10:45	I 'd be very very careful \[ and , \+ \] uh , you know , *-1 checking them out . E_S
21:27	So , I was very comfortable , you know , in *-1 doing it when it got to the point that we had *-2 to do it *T*-3 *T*-4 . E_S
23:78	well , I had an occasion for my mother-in-law who *T*-1 had fell and \[ needed * to be , \+ \] you know , could not take care of herself anymore , was confined *-2 to a nursing home for a while E_S
26:33	I mean , we did n't have , you know , like six months *-1 to check all of these places out . E_S
37:68	But it 's really a \[ big , \+ uh , big , \] uh , decision \[ as to , \+ you know , when * to \] do it *T*-1 . E_S
41:10	You know , is there something else 0 we could have done *T*-1 , you know , in *-2 checking out all the places that , uh , *T*-3 might be available . E_S

42:54	Of course , you know , there 's not one on every corner , especially , you know , smaller areas , smaller towns . E_S
53:58	and , um , she had used the walker \[ for , \+ for \] quite some time , probably about six to nine months . E_S
71:29	Because \[ it was , \+ you know , it was \] just a \[ change of , \+ change of \] location E_S
80:14	and , you know , she spent nine months out of the year *-1 just visiting her children . E_S
89:8	I think 0 when she finally came to the realization that , you know , no , \[ I can not , \+ I can not \] take care of myself *T*-1 . E_S
89:47	I think 0 when she finally came to the realization that , you know , no , \[ I can not , \+ I can not \] take care of myself *T*-1 . E_S
96:50	I mean , for somebody who *T*-1 \[ is , \+ \] you know , for most of their life \[ has , \+ has , \] uh , not just merely had a farm but had ten children had a farm , ran everything because her husband was away in the coal mines . E_S
103:14	And , you know , * facing that situation , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] quite a dilemma . E_S
107:8	I think , N_S
114:5	probably one of the biggest decisions I think that *T*-1 was very strengthening for our family was rather than * have one child make that decision than just * delegate it . E_S
114:28	probably one of the biggest decisions I think that *T*-1 was very strengthening for our family was rather than * have one child make that decision than just * delegate it . E_S
118:8	I think that \[ they , \+ they \] had a great deal of , um , N_S
124:44	And , I mean , \[ it was just , \+ it was probably \] one of the most strengthening things for our family , * getting down together and doing that . E_S
128:84	\[ And , \+ and \] just the children were involved in the decision *ICH*-1 , because it involved just them . \[ And , \+ \] you know , * making that decision and then finding a place E_S
137:10	You know , whether it was just , you know , * giving money or whether it was actually * taking part in a lot , of the decision making , you know , like *-1 finding a proper nursing home . E_S

184:85	We were lucky \[ in , that \+ in one \] respect in that after she had her stroke she was n't \[ really , \+ you know , really \] much aware of what *T*-1 was going on . E_S
188:32	That nursing home life would not have been , you know , anything of her choosing , E_S
197:41	Well , \[ with my , \+ with my \] grandmother I think \[ it was , \+ it was \] such \[ that , \+ uh , that \] she did not have the problem with , N_S

236:47	And , um , \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] think that what one thing that they were concerned *T*-1 probably was the fact 0 it was n't necessarily , you know , like the quantity of care but the quality of , care . E_S

279:10	You know \[ it 's , \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] interesting \[ that , \+ that \] \[ a lot , \+ \] the population of the United States is changing because , you know , uh , now that so many more minorities , where they have had extended families for such a long time *T*-2 . E_S

291:48	But , I guess 0 as we become more industrialized and more , you know , less in a rural situation \[ \[ \[ \[ we , \+ we do n't , \] \+ we , \] \+ we , \] \+ we \] choose *-1 not to deal with the , extended family because we feel 0 it 's kind of cumbersome , when in reality it makes things much much easier *T*-2 . E_S
313:38	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] think that \[ perhaps , \+ perhaps \] the extended family , you know , that it maybe one of the solutions to a lot of things even child care . E_S

864:51	And \[ the first kind of invasion of , \+ the first type of privacy \] seemed *T*-2 invaded *-1 to me , and very much everyday in this country , E_S

900:8	I think 0 they prey on people 's , um , inherent politeness on the phone even with the machine . E_S

935:13	I do n't think 0 I 'd like the K G B \[ is \+ \] monitoring my phone or anything like that . E_S

1032:20	I mean , you know , you ca n't tell it , what a company really has *-1 to do *T*-2 with it E_S
1033:59	and there 's something rather ominous about * having virtually anyone , any hacker being able *-1 to know what your income is *T*-2 , what your spending habits are *T*-3 , E_S
1034:25	\[ \[ and , \+ you know , and , \] \+ and \] that hacker just has *-1 to get \[ in to , \+ in touch \] with the sneak thief E_S
1042:9	so , maybe that is \[ a , \+ a \] little bit of what privacy is *T*-1 . E_S
1049:11	I also thought about it , \[ was of , \+ \] uh , *-1 waiting *-2 to talk to you that , another thing that *T*-4 occurred to me is 0 there is not so much invasion of my privacy because I know how *-5 to behave *T*-6 such that there is n't *?* . E_S

1060:5	certainly the language 0 I know *T*-1 does n't , but just says a word for loneliness . E_S

1086:10	You know , it very much is *?* . E_S
1097:88	and they start *-1 asking questions and in the sense are \[ \[ invite- , \+ invade , \] \+ invading \] your privacy although , if you know what the social norms are *T*-2 , you know , quote unquote , you asked for it . E_S
1097:116	and they start *-1 asking questions and in the sense are \[ \[ invite- , \+ invade , \] \+ invading \] your privacy although , if you know what the social norms are *T*-2 , you know , quote unquote , you asked for it . E_S
1103:25	and it was n't until I was thinking about it just now that I realized 0 that 's actually something that *T*-1 's culturally relative . E_S
1106:13	I have n't thought about that E_S
1107:60	\[ and , \+ and \] that it *EXP*-2 's fascinating * \[ to , \+ to \] think a lot of someone who *T*-1 does n't know how *-3 to say private *T*-4 . E_S

1117:31	and \[ it 's obvious , \+ you know , the results of sex are quite obvious , \] , as the population goes up an extra hundred million every few years . E_S
1121:70	for al- , N_S of the time 0 I 've spent *T*-1 there , I still do n't quite understand how certain things that I assume 0 *T*-2 and require privacy and require not just that you be alone but actually that you have a sense of privacy *T*-3 . E_S
1130:53	And if that 's gone , um , \[ I , \+ I \] really do n't know how *-1 to live *T*-2 very well , E_S
1172:65	or you hear somebody all ready starting , reading off a list of stuff that they 've read *T*-1 probably a thousand times that day already . E_S
1200:10	and I think 0 a law should be passed *-1 to where any of these people , N_S
1201:8	I think 0 it *EXP*-1 's great , that you know , freedom of speech in this country and everything , N_S
1201:38	I think 0 it *EXP*-1 's great , that you know , freedom of speech in this country and everything , N_S
1202:159	but if they 're going *-1 to offer these services , or these recorded message , everything , they ought *-2 to be stuck *-3 * working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer *-4 to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them . E_S
1224:32	* Living in an apartment complex though , you know \[ you ca n't , \+ um , you ca n't \] really stop those people from * coming around even though they put up signs *ICH*-1 out front that *T*-2 says no solicitations , uh , E_S
1225:44	but they still come up to the front door and , uh , you know , walk around . E_S
1226:87	So , usually what I do *T*-1 is 0 I 'll call the apartment manager and tell them hey , there 's people coming around , you know , E_S
1233:41	It was n't even what I would consider *T*-1 , you know , family hours , E_S
1234:26	time 0 * to , you know , start *-1 going to bed *T*-2 E_S
1241:10	but I think 0 they should also respect the sanctity of the American home , whether it be in a house or in an apartment . E_S
1244:28	otherwise , I do n't want *-1 to know 0 they exist . E_S
1250:57	If they want *-1 to choose that particular religion that 's fine with me too , you know , as long as they do n't try and pull me in and drag me in . E_S
1256:22	and , uh , I do n't know , E_S

1265:13	I do n't know how much clearer it can be *T*-1 , E_S
1276:8	I probably could do the same thing , uh , you know , E_S

1303:8	I believe 0 we 've pretty much summed everything up . E_S
1305:8	I know , E_S
1308:18	well * let me think , E_S
1312:10	and I thought yeah , E_S
1351:25	And , uh , I called you know , from \[ \[ that , \+ the , \] \+ the \] T I Data Base Calling Instructions . E_S
1367:8	I think 0 there really is *?* . E_S
1374:8	I think 0 you have *-1 to push one E_S
1387:48	like I said I guess 0 it would be the work force , you know , as far as changes in the generations . E_S
1390:8	I know because , I know 0 when my mother was \[ a , \+ \] you know , going into the work force *T*-1 there was n't very many opportunities for her , I guess , E_S

1396:73	I think 0 \[ no- , \+ now , \] you go to work when they 're six weeks old , you know *T*-1 , E_S
1401:32	And I feel like the next generation , you 'll probably just work right along with your husband , you know . E_S
1401:62	And I feel like the next generation , you 'll probably just work right along with your husband , you know . E_S
1405:8	I think 0 it 's definitely gotten better . E_S
1416:21	I mean I ca n't think of a field that they 're not involved in *T*-2 . E_S
1421:10	And I know 0 at least in the medical field , it seems like they 've come out with a lot further advances as far as female medications and things since women have gotten into the doctor field . E_S

1425:13	I do n't think that men really took the time 0 * to work on that sort of thing *T*-1 . E_S
1428:21	even in Washington , you know , there seems *-1 to be a lot more women involved . E_S
1428:29	even in Washington , you know , there seems *-1 to be a lot more women involved . E_S
1439:8	I think 0 that would be the best goal . E_S
1452:13	I kind of think , maybe in time , that , you know , you 'll go by social security numbers , you know , E_S

1452:71	I kind of think , maybe in time , that , you know , you 'll go by social security numbers , you know , E_S
1456:68	and that way they ca n't say well they picked a male over a female , female over a male , you know , E_S
1460:28	or the way 0 you , you know , N_S
1466:8	I think 0 that would be a wonderful way 0 * to do it *T*-1 . E_S
1469:63	just * go by your social security number and then look at you qualifications \[ that , \+ you know , that \] you have *T*-1 . E_S
1474:30	And then if you get it , you know then , N_S
1477:69	also , with , uh , women in the work force they 've gotten a lot more options as far as , you know , what 's it called *-2 *T*-1 , job sharing . E_S
1491:8	it sure is *?* . E_S
1495:8	It sure is *?* . E_S
1497:30	Or , a lot of women 0 I know now *T*-1 and \[ my , \+ uh , one of my \] supervisors , when she went on L O A *-2 to have her baby *T*-3 , we hooked up , uh , uh , a terminal at her house E_S
1498:24	and \[ she , \+ you know , we \] could send her messages , E_S
1514:44	All 0 it \[ was *T*-1 , \+ was , \] you know , N_S
1517:10	so I think 0 that 's real nice too , * to come up with different options . E_S
1525:8	I think 0 it 's great . E_S
1530:21	and the next week , you know , I 'll work three E_S and she 'll work two , E_S
1554:42	and that way we 're not really missing any thing out , you know , of MUMBLEx children , E_S
1567:56	but we do n't want *-1 to miss any of those P T A -s and , you know , all of that . E_S
1571:8	I think , N_S
1578:8	I think 0 it 's great , E_S
1586:10	you know , when that subject comes up *T*-1 they can say yes , E_S
1593:35	so you do n't have *-1 to *?* , you know , unless you 're just really sick , or the child 's sick . E_S
1595:27	Most of the time now , you know , it 's just the weekend , E_S

1609:13	I do n't know how many times I 've done that *T*-1 *-2 to do something , post office or the bank or any kind of errand , E_S
1617:11	Well I think 0 we 've really come a long way in that because , N_S
1625:10	But I know , N_S
1634:39	I can remember my mother getting in trouble if , you know , one of was sick , E_S
1635:10	and I know 0 she probably did n't make hardly anything , you know , compared to the work that she did *T*-1 . E_S

1635:43	and I know 0 she probably did n't make hardly anything , you know , compared to the work that she did *T*-1 . E_S
1639:8	I think 0 there is still some discrimination there where \[ as , \+ \] you know , men and women work in the same job *T*-1 , E_S

1658:8	I think 0 it 's getting better , not worse . E_S
1659:16	Well , I should probably get back to my job . E_S
1661:8	I know , E_S
1662:8	I know the feeling . E_S

1767:38	A lot of times you 'll hear songs that you know , 0 *T*-1 they 're not original , but have been put *-2 to a rap kind of a rhythm . E_S

2005:8	I think that they do n't use , elec- , N_S
2012:14	so , you know , well a lot of the stuff 0 you hear *T*-1 coming from South Africa *ICH*-2 now , and from West Africa , that 's considered *-3 world music , because it 's not particularly using certain types of folk styles . E_S
2012:123	so , you know , well a lot of the stuff 0 you hear *T*-1 coming from South Africa *ICH*-2 now , and from West Africa , that 's considered *-3 world music , because it 's not particularly using certain types of folk styles . E_S
2019:35	and Miles Davis worked with Robbie Shoncar , if you can believe it , E_S

2071:64	so I take half of that amount out of my checkbook \[ each , \+ with each \] paycheck , even thought it 's really still there , so that I can keep , uh , uh , good balance , a running total , yeah through the month , E_S
2086:70	Uh , \[ we 've , \+ we 've , \] uh , taken how much we have *T*-2 , you know , write down how much we have *T*-1 coming in each month E_S
2089:47	We \[ sat dow- , \+ made up \] different accounts like , you know , E_S
2090:34	we 've set a budget for each , you know , household expenses , or food , and clothing and entertainment and then \[ our , \+ our \] own fun money and just stuff like that E_S
2092:63	and at the end of the month we tally it up *-1 to see how close we , you know N_S
2093:41	\[ we , \+ we \] try *-1 to stay within a certain budget , E_S
2112:17	so I , you know , N_S
2113:26	and then we have that , you know , N_S
2114:87	\[ if you ca n't stay , \+ if something comes up and you ca n't stay \] within it then we have , uh , you know , a budget for , you know , like 0 we call *T*-1 our slush fund or something E_S

2121:31	because \[ we do n't , \+ you know , we do n't \] charge anything that we ca n't pay *T*-1 off by the end of the month . E_S

2188:31	\[ and , then , \+ uh , you know and then \] \[ when , \+ if \] we need it we wait until \[ it , \+ it 's \] expired E_S
2198:130	and they did an analysis *ICH*-4 for us based on what we were putting *T*-1 in and the time frame that we wanted *-2 to look at *T*-3 , and then gave us \[ a good idea back , \+ you know , some good information *ICH*-6 back \] on whether or not we were going *-5 to achieve those goals , \[ and , \+ or \] not , and what we needed *-7 to do *T*-8 so that we could achieve them and the money 0 we could put *T*-9 in at what time .

2252:29	therefore , \[ my , \+ my \] reading pleasures are quite wide . E_S
2263:38	and \[ I , \+ I \] really enjoyed , you know , all the little things *ICH*-2 that you find *T*-1 out about Texas . E_S
2276:54	and then I 'll sit up and read * just to refresh , uh , you know , to keep active on it , E_S

2301:13	I do n't know that I read anything strictly labeled * self improvement . E_S

2326:230	Um , every now and then I 'm loaned *-3 a tape 0 I can stick *T*-1 \[ in the , \+ uh , in the \] car cassette set on the way home * to make the drive more enjoyable , talking about , uh , better outlooks on things and the philosophy \[ of , \+ of \] Pat Hagerty and these kind of , uh , mind stimulating philosophy type .

2342:18	Well , I do n't know , um , E_S

2380:13	I 'm not sure 0 I could take too much of Stephen King . E_S

2418:18	I need *-1 to probably make a phone call or two . E_S
2436:13	I do n't know about you E_S

2443:38	they tend *-1 to try *-2 to be , you know , real lax E_S

4174:28	Uh , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 what they are trying *-1 to say *T*-2 , is that there is a great deal of historical truth , E_S but 0 the interpretation that *T*-1 actually got into the writing of the Bible itself is probably uh , after the what , uh , \[ was \+ is \] it *T*-2 the King James Version when the committee \[ did it , \+ wrote the translation *T*-4 , \] that so much was lost *-3 in the translation , particularly since most of the translations were in Greek .

4199:27	You can look at it , you know , N_S
4221:22	But , uh , I do n't know if \[ there is , \+ there is \] a time limit on this ,

4299:60	She feels like if it 's something that you have *-1 to do *T*-2 , you know , if you look at it as if you have *-3 to do it , then \[ it becomes , \+ it becomes \] a chore , E_S

4440:9	And , maybe not , N_S
4441:13	I do n't know about rural California too well . E_S

4521:36	And , part of it is 0 California , you know , \[ in , \+ back in \] the sixties , had a lot of alternative movements E_S

4553:26	\[ I , \+ I \] sometimes think that it 's almost frantic effort on the part of the people in the city . E_S

4570:26	well \[ I , \+ I \] think so . E_S
4576:11	like I know a little bit about people who *T*-1 were considered *-2 very healthy in China E_S
4579:30	and they combine it with a , you know , meditation or whatever . Some sort of relaxation E_S
4583:12	and , they seem pretty , you know , N_S

4593:17	Well , do n't you think 0 a lot of that is diet too ? E_S
4610:41	so , uh , I 've read a lot of information , * knowing that to be true , E_S

4715:8	You know where Saint Joe is *T*-1 ? E_S
4726:15	Well , you know , \[ I 've , \+ I 've \] seen those statistics and everything , E_S

4746:13	Oh , I know , E_S
4747:8	I know . E_S
4748:8	I know . E_S
4749:13	Um , I think 0 nowadays people \[ just , \+ really just , \]
4750:28	murder is nothing to them , you know . E_S
4753:47	And , I 've come to the conclusion , and this is a pretty scary thought to me , even , that if a guy is convicted *-1 , or a gal is convicted *-2 , of a crime , rather than * put them in prison , because prison 's proven *-3 not to work , just let them go . E_S
4765:55	because , uh , most likely that will happen , wo n't it *?* , that , you know , N_S
4767:13	Well , I think that the best hope to eliminate crime , as we know it today is * to eliminate the criminals from society . E_S
4767:47	Well , I think that the best hope to eliminate crime , as we know it today is * to eliminate the criminals from society . E_S
4774:15	If someone is known *-1 to have been in prison , they ca n't get a job . E_S
4778:8	You know . E_S
4783:10	You know , if they 're not going *-1 to be accepted *-2 into society , then everybody 's going *-3 to become sociopathic . E_S
4787:14	And , you know , who *T*-1 's *-2 to put the limit on it ? E_S
4790:10	You know , I mean , some of these guys are forty years old and got ten convictions . E_S
4805:13	Well , they may find a cure for it , E_S
4806:15	but there is no known cure now . E_S
4808:42	Um . So \[ you 're , \+ you 're \] kind of thinking , N_S
4809:88	in other words , \[ if you get , \+ if you do \] something *ICH*-1 the first time , that *T*-2 's not real bad , you know , E_S
4811:16	Hey , people make mistakes . E_S
4819:14	or , you know , there 's other consequences rather than * killing them , you know , E_S
4819:53	or , you know , there 's other consequences rather than * killing them , you know , E_S
4827:9	You know . E_S
4831:13	At least they might get some benefit in that , E_S
4832:109	and if the people 0 they committed a crime against *T*-1 , feel , at some later date , that these people have learned their lesson , \[ are , \+ are \] okay , you know , well , they can free them . E_S
4836:19	But , uh , you know , with the technology 0 we have *T*-1 today , you can put a collar *ICH*-3 on a guy 's leg that *T*-2 will knock him down if they leave the property . E_S
4845:14	But , you know , * putting them in prison , my God , that does n't work . E_S
4861:46	I mean , if you get convicted *-1 of , uh , you know , drug trafficking , they just kill you . E_S
4862:33	You get convicted *-1 of , uh , you know , heinous crimes , they just kill you . E_S
4869:11	You know , and you look at our society , almost everyone out on the street that *T*-1 has been in prison , has been in prison three or four times . E_S
4874:20	I mean , You know , the way 0 * to stop that kind of behavior *T*-1 \[ is , \+ is \] two-fold . E_S
4877:8	I know . E_S
4881:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 that 's very important . E_S
4894:14	Because , you know , we are what we teach *T*-1 . E_S

4960:43	and they react to what they see *T*-1 at home . You know . E_S
4968:10	You know . It really is *?* , E_S
4971:39	Well , you can see it in the work place , you know . E_S
4977:15	Now , you know , people get fired *-1 , E_S
4990:49	And one of the things that *T*-1 's in their culture that I really think 0 the major corporations should pay attention to *T*-2 , is the fact that , while Japan was becoming a great power , financially , the people that *T*-3 worked for those companies , worked for the same company 0 they worked for *T*-4 at sixty-five , as they did when they were eighteen *T*-5 . E_S
5002:10	You know , transcribing stuff into the computer . E_S
5013:14	But , you know , her preference is *-1 to be in an office situation where her job is ... N_S
5036:40	He likes *-1 to help me design , um , you know , projects that *T*-2 are , a little more customized . E_S
5058:41	In fact , I did one , BILL THE CAT , you know , from Glenn County that , uh , *T*-2 was a real good one 0 * to do *T*-1 . E_S
5073:20	But , now I do n't know . E_S
5080:26	I do n't have them all yet certainly . E_S
5089:17	and , uh , I think 0 I have , what was it *T*-1 two hundred , E_S
5090:20	and I got *-1 to thinking 0 the money that I 've got *T*-2 invested *-3 in this is , uh , N_S
5095:81	and then when I start a new project *T*-1 , I go through and see \[ if I , \+ if I , \] you know , N_S
5103:54	Well , now can I improvise with * adding and using another color *ICH*-2 instead , you know , what *T*-1 comes close . Because a lot of them are similar . E_S
5110:8	I think , 0 I N_S
5196:24	I 've been doing it for probably ten years or so . E_S
5200:38	I just started about , well , five years ago , I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
5208:10	and I think 0 \[ the other one is going . \+ The child is going \] *-1 to be in high school before I get finished . E_S
5228:33	It 's \[ an- , \+ \] cloth I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
5238:27	and the lady said 0 she could n't believe that they know that I had done it in the colors , that they had decorated the nursery *T*-1 E_S
5238:37	and the lady said 0 she could n't believe that they know that I had done it in the colors , that they had decorated the nursery *T*-1 E_S
5239:18	and I did n't even know it . E_S
5244:23	and she said how did you know 0 those are the colors 0 we used *T*-1 *T*-2 . E_S
5264:20	She said , 0 I know 0 she does n't get *-1 to touch it . E_S
5314:14	of course I think , 0 Saddam Hussein only allowed C N N to broadcast it , E_S
5319:45	It *EXP*-1 was unusual * not to have the different sources , you know , of news coverage . E_S
5322:18	Um , I do n't know . E_S
5323:33	I guess , uh , 0 I do n't even know why I watched C N N *T*-1 . E_S
5328:13	well , I know 0 even if you watched A B C , N B C or the other , E_S
5355:18	you ca n't really be sure of the quality of what you 've got *T*-1 , you know . E_S
5355:57	you ca n't really be sure of the quality of what you 've got *T*-1 , you know . E_S
5370:57	and so it really made me question as to \[ what , \+ how \] do we know , you know , uh , if the news 0 we 're getting *T*-2 is any good *T*-1 . E_S
5370:67	and so it really made me question as to \[ what , \+ how \] do we know , you know , uh , if the news 0 we 're getting *T*-2 is any good *T*-1 . E_S
5374:45	I guess , 0 the news just focuses on major events that *T*-1 probably , do n't affect ninety-nine percent of the people who *T*-2 are right there when the news is being made *-3 *T*-4 . E_S
5384:82	and , I mean \[ they were , \+ they were \] very minor kinds of things from my point of view , and it seemed *ICH*-1 , you know , from anyone else 's point of view , E_S

5473:17	But , uh , I know some people at T I , E_S
5500:15	So I do n't know , E_S
5502:8	it seems to me 0 it says 0 you are suppose *-1 to talk for three minutes , E_S

5733:8	I probably wo n't do it until I , N_S
5738:10	Oh , probably be another twelve years . E_S
5742:15	Oh , you know I like what I 'm doing *T*-1 right now . E_S

5899:13	I do n't know , E_S

5916:128	\[ It 's like , \+ it 's like \] \[ have you , \+ \[ have \+ have \] you \] ever seen the commercial like for Federal Express \[ where the , \+ with , uh , the \] think tank ? You know , E_S

5996:32	That 's why they can say , you know , 0 there 's no layoff policy *T*-1 . E_S

6206:23	and I suspect that that 's probably true for everyone . E_S
6214:17	I had never really thought of it that way E_S
6219:19	But , uh , you know , \[ I was just , \+ as a matter of fact , I just , \] uh , celebrated my fifth year at T I the end of last month and , uh , kind of started *-1 looking through \[ the , \+ the \] book because of that , you know , E_S

6221:14	and , you know , \[ when you 're , \+ when you 're , \] you know , in your , N_S

6225:38	I guess 0 now is the time 0 * to think about it *T*-1 , E_S
6226:40	so . Does T I have a pretty good retirement package , do you think ? E_S
6228:8	I think 0 they have , uh , \[ a- , \+ one \] that we need *-3 to recognize that we 're going *-1 to have *-2 to supplement *T*-4 ourselves . E_S

6260:29	Well , \[ they just , \+ they seem \] *-1 to make it *EXP*-2 so easy * to save . E_S

6265:36	I kind of have *-1 to trade off , you know . E_S
6274:13	Uh , * believe me ,

6286:56	\[ \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ \[ fr- , \+ \] you know , I , \] \+ I \] debate about whether it 's really good or not , you know . E_S

6296:40	Uh , it 's shown a history that , uh , *T*-1 sure beats anything else . Over many , many years . E_S
6304:66	and , uh , one of the things that we talked about *T*-1 with the counselor there was , you know , N_S

6307:27	We have a two year old , you know , E_S
6308:28	\[ and , \+ and , \] you know , we ca n't start *-1 saving for college when he 's sixteen *T*-2 , you know , E_S

6313:24	and it 's just really scary the thought of how much it 's going *-1 to , N_S
6316:86	And they sat down and figured up that we needed *-1 to save like between fifteen and seventeen hundred dollars a year at a , oh , you know , six percent interest rate , *-1 to be able *-2 to have , you know , money for his college . E_S
6316:131	And they sat down and figured up that we needed *-1 to save like between fifteen and seventeen hundred dollars a year at a , oh , you know , six percent interest rate , *-1 to be able *-2 to have , you know , money for his college . E_S
6317:73	And that 's exactly what we have *T*-1 coming out in saving bonds , \[ is , \+ is , \] you know , about fifteen hundred dollars a year . E_S
6318:29	So , I guess 0 it , you know , N_S
6319:23	in that way , at least we know that that 's taken care of *-1 , you know . E_S
6319:55	in that way , at least we know that that 's taken care of *-1 , you know . E_S
6341:18	You better make * sure that you 've got a scholarship . E_S
6349:41	\[ And , \+ and \] our answer was , that , you know , we will have enough money *ICH*-1 available for him to attend a state college . E_S

6353:29	you just ca n't do it , you know . E_S

6409:50	Uh , I can see \[ some , \+ some \] potential changes that *T*-1 probably \[ \[ are , \+ are , \] \+ would \] not cost very much but might , uh , make things a little easier . Such as * offering \[ a , \+ a \] smorgasbord . Having a larger variety of benefits E_S

6432:11	You know , if you 've been there , you know , under five years \[ and \+ \] you get two weeks of vacation E_S but that 's really not enough E_S and you want an extra week , then you can purchase an extra week of vacation by *-2 saying , okay , I 'm going *-1 to want an extra five days this year E_S

7904:8	I think 0 it 's the Bart man , the Simpsons . E_S
7948:11	I would think 0 it , E_S
7950:59	I mean it 's good because \[ they , \+ they \] try new things , you know , E_S

8107:33	and we started *-1 talking about gangs , you know . E_S
8130:52	\[ and , \+ uh , and \] she was telling me all her problems , you know , E_S
8139:22	but the topic was boring I thought 0 *T*-1 . E_S
8147:32	it was , um , about movies , you know , what have you seen *T*-1 at the movies lately and stuff like that . E_S
8171:40	And \[ he , \+ he \] said 0 he did n't think 0 it should have gotten all those awards ,

8196:8	You probably do n't want *T*-1 to take them *-2 to see SILENCE OF THE LAMBS . E_S
8203:10	You know , they 've got it all figured *-1 out . E_S
8227:8	I know . E_S
8238:8	I know . E_S
8256:52	and I felt like it kind of got chopped *-1 off at the end , you know . E_S
8258:13	I do n't know , E_S
8279:8	* sure did . E_S
8307:14	But , you know , in the movie the guy was black , E_S
8323:15	Well , do you think 0 we covered baseball ? E_S
8325:8	I think so . E_S
8340:27	And , um , as we did with probably ninety-five percent of the people here in Dallas-Fort Worth we bought a Fox and Jacobs home , E_S
8345:33	If you ca n't afford something good , you know , E_S
8359:49	and price-wise , it was great because he did it all himself , you know , E_S

8387:8	Nothing wrong with that , E_S
8389:8	You know . E_S
8396:24	and he came in , you know , and did the inside for us , E_S
8404:16	nothing , you know , E_S
8413:34	well , have you any plans * to , uh , maybe , uh , expand or move onward ? E_S
8418:13	and we had thought before maybe a lot older 0 we do n't need such a large house that we 'll sell it , E_S
8418:20	and we had thought before maybe a lot older 0 we do n't need such a large house that we 'll sell it , E_S
8431:89	and that can basically \[ be , \+ be \] put \[ on any lot , \+ in any state , \] \[ any kin- , \+ \] you know , E_S
8441:25	so \[ at \+ \] least we know 0 \[ we 're , \+ it 's \] not going *-1 to fall in or something if it 's built *-2 . E_S
8461:34	But , uh , like I said otherwise , you know , \[ a- , \+ the expense , \] N_S

8479:43	\[ Ap- , \+ apparently \] the appraisers likes it because our taxes sure is high . E_S
8485:49	because \[ I , \+ I 'm \] always shocked at about , you know , what they have it appraised *-2 at *T*-1 , E_S
8486:8	I think , oh my goodness . E_S
8504:85	but the thing \[ is , \+ is \] that , um , I have *-1 to keep it under control because , for example , you know , it 's like \[ the , \+ the \] beginning of the semester when you go *-2 to pay for everything *T*-3 , everything is pretty rough , E_S
8506:22	but , then whenever , you know , N_S
8523:52	So , the thing \[ is , \+ is \] basically that I spend , like , maybe thirty-five , forty dollars every two weeks \[ on , \+ on \] groceries E_S
8525:35	But the thing , uh , also is that , you know , like if you want *-1 to go out like if you want *-2 to go to a restaurant or something , then I have *-3 to moderate that because it 's like I ca n't go *-4 eat out at a nice restaurant and spend twenty dollars , um , you know , three times a week .

8531:33	\[ for , \+ for \] us , you know , it 's like , \[ \[ I , I \+ \] can spend , \+ I can spend \] that money E_S

8554:69	Well , the thing \[ is , \+ is \] that , um , \[ I ba- , \+ I basically \] know how much I have *T*-1 , right ? E_S
8563:62	And besides see one of my biggest expenses is telephone calls since I have *-1 to call , you know , international . E_S
8587:51	if you want *-1 to save money I wo n't call so often , you know , E_S
8597:21	What *T*-1 makes you , think so ? E_S
8613:30	Since it 's his money anyway , you know . E_S
8623:25	So , it 's basically , you know , N_S
8626:32	so I wo n't have *-1 to , you know , rush a letter to him or something , E_S
8637:16	And what do you think 0 you 'll do *T*-1 with that ? E_S
8662:10	you know , anywhere from , um , local area networks , metropolitan area networks , you know , all that , E_S
8662:52	you know , anywhere from , um , local area networks , metropolitan area networks , you know , all that , E_S
8696:11	We 're probably like most \[ Am- , \+ American \] families ,
8697:42	I guess , that we sort of have a budget in that we know how much we 've got *T*-1 at the end of the month , E_S
8701:10	and we know what bills *T*-1 have *-2 to be paid *-3 , E_S
8707:8	Oh sure . E_S
8708:28	We 're like everybody else , you know , E_S
8709:84	we 've got \[ a , \+ several \] credit cards that sometimes , um , instead of *-1 paying *T*-2 them all off every month maybe you have *-1 to slip some and you pay part of it this month and part of it next month especially around Christmas time . E_S
8714:10	You know , that 's when everybody goes crazy on * charging stuff *T*-1 . E_S
8718:29	and \[ \[ I , \+ you know , I \] do n't wa- , \+ I do n't like \] *-1 to give any at all E_S
8722:41	because the thing \[ is , \+ is \] that , you know , it 's like if I want something \[ I 'll , \+ I 'll \] ask somebody , you know , E_S

8758:51	\[ it was , \+ to me it was \] ridiculous , E_S because you know , you have *-2 to , N_S

8774:13	I do n't know that you need *-1 to be involved in a lot of frivolous gift giving , you know , E_S
8774:65	I do n't know that you need *-1 to be involved in a lot of frivolous gift giving , you know , E_S
8787:22	and I spent around like , maybe , two hundred dollars . E_S
8791:31	\[ So , \+ uh , but \] you know , it 's like , um . N_S

8810:67	And if I felt like I spent way to much then , um , I wo n't go out , you know , E_S
8819:52	\[ but , \+ um , but \] \[ \[ it was , \+ you know , it was , \] \+ I guess 0 it was \] worth it , E_S
8824:10	You know , it was a nice place . E_S
8833:8	I know the feeling . E_S
8857:67	so there 's not a whole a lot of time that I 've got *T*-1 , uh , for hobbies it seems like *T*-2 lately . E_S
8859:101	And that , oh , I guess , ranges anywhere from , uh , carpentry work to , um , um , some types of furniture and , um , oh , I do n't know what you would call them *T*-1 , knickknacks , I guess , stuff 0 you hang *T*-2 on the wall *-3 to put a mirror on *T*-2 E_S
8866:13	I do n't know if it 's the saw dust or the mess 0 you make *T*-1 or the smell of the wood E_S

8874:10	You know I do n't have *-1 to worry about *-2 getting stuff on the carpet except when I track in saw dust *T*-3 , E_S
8904:10	but I think 0 \[ the , \+ the \] temperature has been pretty good *ICH*-1 so far for * working outside . E_S

8939:8	I think tha- , N_S
8948:18	Well , I 'm not sure what she does *T*-1 E_S
8950:78	first thing that *T*-1 comes to mind is some kind of chain stitch because she starts and goes all the way across , you know , back and forth until she winds up with this big piece \[ of , \+ of \] afghan . E_S

9016:8	I think 0 I had three or four seeds in each one of them , E_S
9019:5	maybe it was because it was too dry , E_S

9090:85	, I mean , N_S \[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 it 's the stuff that *T*-1 comes out of automobile exhaust , you know , E_S
9095:12	So , I believe them E_S
9098:33	\[ Do you , \+ uh , do you \] think that those are bigger contributors than things like \[ ai- , \+ acid \] rain and some of the pollutants that *T*-1 come from , uh , industrial areas , factories and so on ? E_S
9100:16	I do n't really know , um , E_S
9133:33	Um , \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know if you \[ he- , \+ \[ re- , \+ \] heard \] about the , uh , recent legislation in , uh , Colorado , uh , against a power company , uh , that *T*-1 's actually on Indian land , I believe 0 *T*-2 , E_S
9133:160	Um , \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know if you \[ he- , \+ \[ re- , \+ \] heard \] about the , uh , recent legislation in , uh , Colorado , uh , against a power company , uh , that *T*-1 's actually on Indian land , I believe 0 *T*-2 , E_S
9134:54	but , uh , it has been ruled against *-1 , uh , regarding air pollution because they think that it 's causing terrible smog over the Grand Canyon .
9146:13	I do n't know that , E_S
9147:65	the information is one of those wire services kind of \[ news , \+ pieces of news , \] you know , E_S
9150:15	so I do n't know . E_S
9154:120	But they said \[ that , \+ that \] it really caused so much smog *ICH*-2 over , uh , the Grand Canyon in the winter months that they could n't do the , uh , piloting , uh , you know , the helicopter trips and that sort of thing . Which *T*-1 would be horrible , because \[ the , \+ there 's \] nothing , E_S
9166:19	Uh , what do you think 0 individuals could do *T*-1 , or society could do *T*-1 * to alleviate this problem . E_S
9168:44	Uh , \[ I do n't , \+ uh , I do n't \] know whether we could do a whole lot as individuals .
9169:10	Uh , maybe just take good care of our cars , and make * sure 0 we keep our pollution devices clean and all that sort of thing .
9169:44	Uh , maybe just take good care of our cars , and make * sure 0 we keep our pollution devices clean and all that sort of thing .
9174:39	apart from that , \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know what we can do *T*-1 as individuals . E_S
9175:14	What do you think 0 we can do *T*-1 ? E_S
9178:8	you think , 0 it 's \[ more , \+ more \] to society . E_S
9182:32	but if we are concerned about it then we certainly can , uh , force , uh , government , uh , that we elect *T*-1 to deal more seriously with it . E_S
9186:13	And I do think that we have a responsibility there . E_S
9188:13	but I do think that , um , Congress has backed down much too much on some of the air pollution standards . E_S
9194:73	\[ the , \+ the , \] uh , lobbyist and , uh , the car manufacturing companies \[ have , \+ uh , you know , have \] really pushed , E_S
9203:89	Um , so I suspect that that 's one thing \[ that , \+ that \] as individuals , we can do *T*-1 , * make our voices known , perhaps to our legislators . E_S
9204:27	But , um , as a society , I think 0 we can do more *T*-1 E_S
9205:13	and that 's probably how we ought *-2 to do it *T*-1 . Uh , \[ individ- , \+ *-2 being individually responsible \] \[ as , uh , gro- , \+ in order *-3 to be group responsible . \] E_S
9208:80	I guess 0 \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] to the point where I 'm cynical enough that I really do n't believe 0 anything will happen \[ unless , \+ unless \] there 's something economically justifiable about it *T*-1 . E_S
9212:32	And in the case of air pollution , it simply might turn out at some point down the road , *-1 to be so costly *ICH*-4 *ICH*-5 * to have *-3 to live with air pollution in terms of health problems , and everything else that we 'll spend the money that *T*-6 's necessary * \[ to , \+ uh , to \] get rid *-2 of the source of it . E_S
9217:75	I suspect \[ that the pub- , \+ \] that there 's going *-1 to have *-2 to be a lot of pressure , uh , come * to bear on the companies that *T*-4 deal with it E_S
9218:7	and probably the only way 0 that can happen *T*-1 is for , um , governments to realize that they have *-2 to pay if companies do n't . E_S
9222:22	And , uh , I do n't know how long \[ that , \+ that \] will take *T*-1 . E_S
9236:48	Well nobody wants *-1 to pay twenty-five cents a kilowatt hour , I do n't think 0 *T*-2 . E_S
9240:13	Uh , I probably would n't mind if it really came down to it . E_S
9255:15	Uh , you know , wha- , N_S
9256:13	however , it might have had other causes . E_S
9259:8	Oh certainly , E_S
9262:15	Um , and I think 0 that 's probably going *-1 to happen \[ with , \+ with \] such things as air pollution ,
9262:28	Um , and I think 0 that 's probably going *-1 to happen \[ with , \+ with \] such things as air pollution ,
9263:115	\[ when we , \+ when we \] \[ se- , \+ get serious \] \[ about cleaning , \+ about our motors \] in our automobiles *T*-2 \[ then , \+ uh , then \] maybe , you know , we 'll have a little bit of help .

10370:11	He 's probably been through all kinds of nightmares . E_S

10972:17	and then , you know , uh , \[ \[ for , \+ for , \] \+ for \] no real , you know , direct reason , I guess 0 *T*-1 , uh , \[ we , \+ we \] get into , uh , uh , a really good relationship for a while and then , you know , back and forth E_S
10972:73	and then , you know , uh , \[ \[ for , \+ for , \] \+ for \] no real , you know , direct reason , I guess 0 *T*-1 , uh , \[ we , \+ we \] get into , uh , uh , a really good relationship for a while and then , you know , back and forth E_S

10978:46	\[ that , \+ it 's \] good because it does make you think , about your own family . E_S
10983:31	And see it did bring out a lot of thoughts between you and your brother . E_S
10994:16	I mean he certainly did n't , N_S
11005:13	I do n't know , E_S
11012:11	* Just think of what a phenomenal actor Dustin Hoffman is *T*-1 . E_S
11023:13	I do n't know about any body else E_S
11027:16	Well , I 'm sure 0 everybody that *T*-1 saw it was believing it right along with them . E_S
11107:36	well we have those *RNR*-2 , uh , which I think 0 *T*-1 is one of the best things is those *RNR*-2 cash for cans . E_S
11108:13	I do n't know if you all have those things around . E_S
11126:14	and , you know , it *EXP*-1 does n't bother them * to walk little bit farther put their aluminum in a can rather than *-2 just throwing it in their trash can . E_S
11141:8	I think 0 what *T*-1 started it at work was that planet earth thing 0 we had *T*-2 last year . E_S
11146:14	but , you know sometimes it dwindles down . E_S
11165:13	And I 'm sure that the , uh , driving factor for * recycling the computer paper is that we get paid *-1 *-1 to do so . E_S
11173:58	Well , \[ it , \+ it \] defrays the cost of * buying the paper , I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
11188:8	I know a lot of companies that *T*-1 waste so much that , N_S
11190:10	you know that was one thing 0 we noticed *T*-1 last week that we had some new people move into our building E_S and , you know , the nice cardboard boxes that you move , packing boxes . And they were just used *-1 one time and thrown *-1 in the dumpster E_S
11190:84	you know that was one thing 0 we noticed *T*-1 last week that we had some new people move into our building E_S and , you know , the nice cardboard boxes that you move , packing boxes . And they were just used *-1 one time and thrown *-1 in the dumpster E_S
11194:10	and I thought , I do n't understand this , you know . E_S
11194:37	and I thought , I do n't understand this , you know . E_S
11200:45	And I do n't understand , sometimes , \[ \[ the way , \+ the thinking , \] \+ the logic \] behind it . E_S
11232:14	So , you know , \[ there , \+ they \] do n't take up much storage space . E_S
11245:8	I thought , well I was doing them a favor by *-1 taking them . E_S
11252:79	\[ so many people need , \+ so many people go \] to the grocery store and stuff and get those boxes , when , you know , these are perfect *T*-1 , E_S
11280:81	That 's what I do *T*-1 with a lot of my daughter 's things is 0 I 'll store \[ her , \+ you know , like her \] out dated or , \[ out of , \+ out of \] season clothes in them E_S
11297:8	I think 0 I 'll have *-1 to try that . E_S
11301:15	well , you know , it 's cheaper than * going and buying the kind at Target that *T*-1 are all ready with the little design on them or whatever . E_S
11321:8	I know 0 you do yours at work , E_S
11328:29	\[ I saved pa- , \+ you know , I recycle paper , \] E_S
11335:90	I mean , I just go ahead and take it to \[ the , \+ the \] regular place , where \[ it 's , \+ you know , they \] just accept it *T*-1 . E_S
11339:27	But \[ they , \+ uh , I think 0 they \] should *?* E_S
11341:28	if they want people to recycle I think 0 *T*-1 it 's , uh , you know , N_S
11341:56	if they want people to recycle I think 0 *T*-1 it 's , uh , you know , N_S
11342:20	like the aluminum , you know , N_S
11343:50	it gets people \[ to , \+ \] uh , *-1 doing it , you know , E_S
11344:13	\[ you might , \+ you do n't \] have *-1 to pay them a lot . E_S
11349:14	in fact I think 0 there 's two of them , that *T*-1 have several openings , E_S
11359:5	maybe there 's two for aluminum . E_S
11375:25	You have *-1 to make * sure 0 you do n't throw away any of the slick paper , like magazines . E_S
11380:18	and you ca n't throw certain file type things away , E_S
11381:13	and I just think 0 it 's such a hassle , E_S
11382:8	it seems like \[ it would be , \+ it *EXP*-1 would be \] easy * to take it all , E_S
11383:13	I do n't know , E_S
11384:21	of course , I do n't know all that about recycling E_S
11385:12	so , it probably is a hassle . E_S
11389:49	But I do get tired of *-1 having *-2 to separate paper , you know . E_S
11418:78	so \[ they 're , \+ they 're \] really , trying *-1 to start *-2 keeping an eye out for those , you know N_S
11419:28	talking to the people again about , you know , N_S
11477:57	And the way 0 it wears off *T*-1 is he goes through all these spastic , you know , uh , N_S
11482:39	and then it gets to where he ca n't , you know , control his movements at all *T*-1 . E_S
11484:17	The way , you know , 0 you have *-1 to just keep *-2 reminding yourself that he 's an actor *T*-3 . E_S
11502:8	I know , E_S
11521:22	That 's why I was thinking 0 it could n't be just a totally funny part *T*-1 . E_S
11534:8	I think 0 the last movie that we went out *-1 to see *T*-2 was DANCES WITH WOLVES . E_S
11553:39	\[ when I , \+ each time that I \] thought that the Indians were going *-1 to get killed *-2 *T*-3 , I cried . E_S
11563:17	And , uh , I think from there on , all the way through the movie . N_S
11580:67	And then \[ he , \+ uh , the next day he \] looked out there and saw those buzzards , you know . E_S
11604:14	What did you think *T*-1 about the buffalo scenes . E_S
11606:13	Oh , I thought 0 it was awful , and so graphic , E_S
11613:37	I mean I had n't even imagined it , you know . E_S
11614:8	I think 0 we all heard the story of the slaughter of the buffalo . E_S
11622:30	Of course they raise them now , you know , 0 * to eat *T*-1 . E_S
11631:16	well at least you know that it was n't same situation that the buffalo died in *T*-1 . E_S
11636:13	Um , I thought 0 the scenes when the buffalos running *T*-1 , though , were beautiful , E_S
11642:13	I did n't know that , that many buffaloes alive , much less in one place . E_S
11649:13	And * to think about how it just changed the whole landscape *T*-1 , you know ,
11649:50	And * to think about how it just changed the whole landscape *T*-1 , you know ,
11657:8	it seemed like the buffaloes were moving so fast . E_S
11659:8	I know . E_S
11672:32	they tried *-1 to keep it , you know , as very close to real . E_S
11700:13	Well , I think 0 we 've made it . E_S
11705:13	I do n't know , E_S
11709:20	oh , E_S I 'm not sure . E_S
11714:11	well I think 0 \[ \[ we 're , \+ we 're , \] \+ we 've \] done okay , though . E_S
11734:27	The , uh , uh , N_S you know
11746:29	and \[ \[ I , \+ you know , we , \] \+ we \] keep *-1 saying oh yes , we feel 0 some day a woman will be president . E_S
11748:8	I think 0 we 'll have a black president \[ b- , \+ before \] we have a women president . E_S
11752:22	And , uh , I do n't know whether that 's bad or good , E_S
11758:41	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] truly believe \[ that , \+ that \] before \[ that , \+ that \] we have *-1 to address the \[ racial , \+ racial \] issues in the United States , before we can go anywhere . E_S
11765:38	Um , because \[ it is so , \+ you know , it 's , \] N_S
11772:18	Uh , oh , I think , 0 \[ we 're , \+ we 're \] supposed *-1 to hang up . E_S
11790:24	could you tell me what you think 0 *T*-1 contributes most to , uh , air pollution ? E_S
11793:29	I mean , while it *EXP*-1 's certainly the case that things like automobiles and factories , uh , pollute a lot , uh , if you look at how much pollution *T*-2 is say kicked *-3 up by an active volcano , uh , it *EXP*-4 's certainly less than clear that anything 0 man can do *T*-5 in this sort of scale of things has much effect at all . E_S

E_S
11794:14	What do you think *T*-1 ? E_S
11797:13	I 'm not sure how many active volcanos there are *T*-1 now , \[ and , \+ and \] what the amount of material that they do , uh , put *T*-2 into the atmosphere . E_S
11798:8	I think 0 probably the greatest cause is , uh , vehicles , especially around cities . E_S
11798:15	I think 0 probably the greatest cause is , uh , vehicles , especially around cities . E_S
11806:10	but I certainly work near a city . E_S
11835:36	And , uh , I 've noticed over the past say , maybe five or six years , uh , N_S
11842:12	And , it seems like , uh , we 're catching all that residue . E_S
11843:13	I 'm not sure if it 's kerosene or what that *T*-1 's dropping . E_S
11844:25	But , other than that , you know , we do n't have \[ the , \+ unless we 're catching it from the midwest , the \] emissions . You know from the power plants .
11844:96	But , other than that , you know , we do n't have \[ the , \+ unless we 're catching it from the midwest , the \] emissions . You know from the power plants .
11859:18	Um , there does n't seem *-1 to be much emission from them , E_S
11860:15	but I 'm not sure about the rest of the country . E_S
11873:52	and they 've got this black ash *ICH*-3 on their cars , which *T*-1 , you know , seems *-2 to be , N_S
11873:57	and they 've got this black ash *ICH*-3 on their cars , which *T*-1 , you know , seems *-2 to be , N_S
11881:21	I mean , I really think that if the E P A had anything on the ball they 'd go in there with a few phosphorous grenades , light up the sky , photograph the emissions at that point , and , uh , you know , N_S
11881:131	I mean , I really think that if the E P A had anything on the ball they 'd go in there with a few phosphorous grenades , light up the sky , photograph the emissions at that point , and , uh , you know , N_S
11889:16	during the night * seems like they 'd blow off \[ their , \+ their \] stacks from , uh , the warehouses , for powerhouses , E_S
11897:14	and , you know , spots all over them . E_S
11909:8	That seems a little ridiculous . E_S
11920:13	I 'm not sure how much the water pollution \[ is , \+ is \] directly related to the air pollution *T*-1 , other than acid rain , E_S
11927:63	I mean the stuff 0 I 've read *T*-1 recently in Technology Review basically indicates that acid rain may be a little bit , uh , overstated . That a lot of the die off 0 they 've seen *T*-2 in forests may not really be due to acid rain at all . E_S

11945:10	and they thought 0 that was more beneficial because , you know \[ \[ it , \+ it , \] \+ some of it \] does soak in E_S
11945:38	and they thought 0 that was more beneficial because , you know \[ \[ it , \+ it , \] \+ some of it \] does soak in E_S
11958:25	But \[ I , \+ I \] thought 0 it was up there . E_S
11966:18	Um , you kind of think 0 it 's something else then ? E_S
11972:21	they just said 0 they thought 0 it was , N_S
11975:21	they just said 0 they thought 0 acid rain 's contribution may be less than * was previously suspected *-1 . Um , that it may be other natural things at work .

11975:82	they just said 0 they thought 0 acid rain 's contribution may be less than * was previously suspected *-1 . Um , that it may be other natural things at work .
11987:22	But , um , I do n't know , E_S
11988:24	I mean , what do you think 0 we can , uh , I guess *RNR*-2 as individuals or as a group , do *T*-1 about , uh , air pollution ? . E_S
11991:11	I still think 0 \[ that 's , \+ that 's , \] uh , one of our major causes of pollutants . E_S
11997:8	I think 0 it *EXP*-1 's up to individuals too , * to ask automakers \[ for , \+ for \] less pollutant vehicles . E_S
12003:45	\[ \[ you ne- , \+ yo- , ne- , \] \+ I think 0 you need \] \[ a , \+ a \] vehicle something like , uh , Ralph Nader , Nader 's Raiders , \[ or , \+ \[ where , \+ \] uh , or , \] uh , uh , A A R P , which *T*-1 has a lot of members . Uh , if you can get those types of groups . E_S
12011:13	Do you really think that new vehicles though is a big problem . E_S
12013:45	\[ the , \+ the \] twelve and fifteen year old cars , you know , contribute like ninety percent , of the automobile pollution E_S
12027:21	Uh , I 'm not really sure . E_S
12028:8	You think \[ \[ that , \+ that , \] \+ that \] \[ the , \+ uh , the \] trucking \[ indus- , \+ industry \] is that , uh , incompetent , that they would n't , you know , N_S
12028:123	You think \[ \[ that , \+ that , \] \+ that \] \[ the , \+ uh , the \] trucking \[ indus- , \+ industry \] is that , uh , incompetent , that they would n't , you know , N_S
12040:26	\[ \[ It , \+ you know , it 's , \] \+ it , \] N_S
12047:10	This country seems *-1 to be a little behind on that . E_S
12073:4	sure . E_S
12077:19	Well , what do you think *T*-1 about like a device , a meter right on a tail pipe E_S
12086:5	maybe \[ you , \+ you \] could probably devise them so it slowly closed off your tail pipe E_S
12086:29	maybe \[ you , \+ you \] could probably devise them so it slowly closed off your tail pipe E_S
12095:19	but , uh , you know , it 's , uh , N_S
12097:10	so you probably would have *-1 to build it right into the muffler or something . E_S
12124:30	You should , uh , pursue that I think 0 *T*-1 , or patent it , you know . E_S
12124:56	You should , uh , pursue that I think 0 *T*-1 , or patent it , you know . E_S
12135:37	But \[ that 's a , \+ that 's a \] thought . E_S
12142:13	I do n't know \[ if you , \+ uh , if you \] approached the automobile industry if they would be too keen on *-1 installing something like that . E_S
12146:17	Uh , but you know a proposal to , uh , uh , I guess the proper authorities , N_S
12150:13	well you might , uh , generate some N_S yeah , E_S you might generate some interest in it . E_S
12150:41	well you might , uh , generate some N_S yeah , E_S you might generate some interest in it . E_S
12156:22	Other than that I 'm not sure \[ what , \+ what \] individuals can do *T*-1 other than like I said *-2 get involved *-3 through a group or an organization . E_S
12173:46	That would be good for a dinner party , \[ that , \+ you know , * to cook that \] because you do n't have *-1 to deal with eight different things , coming out at once . E_S
12209:61	I really wanted *-1 to make red beans and rice \[ and \+ \] with MUMBLEx . you know , sausage , E_S
12223:13	I do n't know why . E_S
12227:13	I do n't know if it 's me or the water or the recipe 0 I have *T*-1 E_S
12244:12	but , it seemed kind of boring compared , N_S
12253:97	because \[ I guess , \+ I guess \] 0 I feel like if they 're on a diet like that , I 'm going *-1 to , you know , honor that , E_S
12263:13	I ca n't believe this E_S
12268:13	I ca n't believe that . E_S
12274:83	And normally \[ I , do n't eat , \+ we do n't eat \] like that during the week because of \[ the , \+ you know , the \] calories and the fat in it . E_S
12278:12	But you know , when we 're having guests *T*-1 , we just kind of say , oh * just do it . E_S
12288:17	But , I do n't think 0 we gained any weight from it E_S
12291:41	Well , every once in a while \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 I feel the same way . E_S
12294:10	so I think 0 dessert is the only thing that I kind of down play *T*-1 , sometimes . E_S
12302:48	But I did bake apples so that it would be , not brownies , you know . E_S
12334:8	I think 0 it *EXP*-1 's , uh , refreshing * to see \[ the , \+ uh , the \] support that the President got *T*-2 from the American people . E_S
12340:8	* seemed that every other time 0 a President *ICH*-2 tried *-1 to get support for an action like , uh , uh , President Carter and his thing with \[ the , \+ the \] hostage crisis *T*-3 , \[ and \+ \] he always did it through rhetoric . E_S
12361:54	so \[ it , \+ uh , it \] was interesting for me , uh , you know , E_S
12365:11	I 'd certainly , uh , N_S
12366:31	\[ I , \+ I \] mean I think 0 it *EXP*-1 's great that all the support . N_S
12386:44	And \[ if , \+ if \] my memory serves me right , I believe 0 a majority of Democrats may even have opposed it , E_S
12386:63	And \[ if , \+ if \] my memory serves me right , I believe 0 a majority of Democrats may even have opposed it , E_S
12391:13	I do n't know the exact figure E_S
12392:125	but \[ I , \+ I \] would imagine that because of \[ the , \+ how close \[ the , \+ the \] \] vote was *T*-1 \[ I 'm , \+ uh , I mean \] * almost certainly would have *-2 to be *?* . E_S
12393:88	Just based on \[ the sheer numbers of , \+ uh , the disparity of , \] * excuse me , Democrats and Republicans in Congress he 'd think that it would have *-1 to have been *?* , um . E_S
12413:8	I think 0 that was , N_S
12414:30	all those factors played a part in , you know , uh , the , N_S
12419:42	but , \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] know that there 's a lot of reasons 0 * to wait longer *T*-1 E_S
12420:10	but I think 0 we were genuinely concerned about \[ how , \+ \] their military capability E_S
12421:27	and \[ we , \+ uh , I think 0 we \] over estimated it , E_S
12424:8	I think so too . E_S
12440:8	Saddam thought 0 he had the whole thing , uh , figured *-3 out \[ to , \+ to \] which way we were coming *T*-2 and \[ which , \+ \[ what , \+ what \] \] our doctrine was *T*-1 \[ that , \+ \] uh , E_S
12442:46	Well , \[ had , \+ had \] we done a frontal assault it probably would have worked more to his favor . E_S
12447:8	I think , uh , 0 this political situation over there now is , uh , uh , N_S
12462:12	And did you know 0 John Sununu is , uh , half Arab ? E_S
12465:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 I did hear that at one time a long time ago , E_S
12473:60	\[ in , \+ in \] fact , when he was Governor of New Hampshire *T*-1 , I believe 0 *T*-2 . E_S
12479:8	I believe 0 he was the only one of fifty governors that *T*-1 voted against some kind of resolution of support for Israel a few years back . E_S
12492:11	I 'd certainly , uh , support Israel \[ in , \+ in \] \[ their , \+ their \] policy \[ that \+ \] in * defending themselves and \[ in , \+ uh , in \] their handling of their foreign policy , E_S
12493:13	\[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 the stand 0 they have *T*-1 , \[ or , \+ or \] the way 0 the command respect *T*-2 , N_S
12493:24	\[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 the stand 0 they have *T*-1 , \[ or , \+ or \] the way 0 the command respect *T*-2 , N_S
12495:8	I think 0 that is \[ a , \+ a \] positive thing for them after , um , uh , thousands of years , E_S
12497:8	I think 0 they in , N_S
12507:20	I lost my train of thought here . E_S
12521:18	and I 'm just not sure \[ that , \+ that \] there 's going *-1 to be any easy permanent solution . E_S
12525:10	and I think 0 that 's the problem 0 the P L O has *T*-1 is that \[ when they , \+ whenever one group of them \] decides that they 're going *-2 to negotiate , or they 're going *-3 to do something , they 're going *-4 to try *-5 to make some peace *T*-6 , \[ but , \+ \] uh , the end result is that \[ they , \+ there \] so many factions of them \[ and , \+ \] uh , some more violent than others , some with a certain agenda different than the others , or they split , E_S
12525:307	and I think 0 that 's the problem 0 the P L O has *T*-1 is that \[ when they , \+ whenever one group of them \] decides that they 're going *-2 to negotiate , or they 're going *-3 to do something , they 're going *-4 to try *-5 to make some peace *T*-6 , \[ but , \+ \] uh , the end result is that \[ they , \+ there \] so many factions of them \[ and , \+ \] uh , some more violent than others , some with a certain agenda different than the others , or they split , E_S
12542:8	I know , E_S
12557:15	and I do n't know if it will ever happen again E_S
12566:25	I guess , uh , well 0 maybe the computer will pair us up together another time . E_S
12568:11	You never know . E_S
12761:13	I do n't know what that is *T*-1 , E_S
12829:30	but it was \[ out , \+ you know , out \] at the State Fair Music Hall E_S
12849:35	\[ Just , \+ just \] ever so often you know , \[ a real , \+ a real \] good one like that one E_S

12988:29	He was the sidekick of Gene Autry I believe 0 *T*-1 E_S

13045:48	\[ \[ You , \+ you 'd , \] \+ well you 'd \] think 0 there would be *?* . E_S

13080:23	Of course , they , you know , just do n't have the quality of records nowadays either because , \[ you , \+ you \] get that scratchy sound . E_S
13118:37	But , \[ I , \+ I \] guess , you know , 0 the old country and western music 0 you , N_S
13135:8	I think 0 it was better back then to , E_S
13140:22	and the radio is , you know , more exciting *ICH*-1 , really , \[ than , \+ than \] television , E_S
13166:18	Uh , uh , * seems like it was on a Friday , E_S
13173:19	uh , what do you think *T*-1 about , uh , the idea of * having volunteer service for everyone ? E_S
13175:13	Uh , I think that , uh , really it *EXP*-1 would n't hurt most of the young people of the country * to have * to go and do voluntary service . E_S
13176:19	Uh , and , you know , I mean , there have been so many people that *T*-1 have done it E_S
13181:10	and I think 0 they 've gotten a lot out of it . E_S
13194:8	I think 0 probably as soon as they finished high school it would be ideal , because a lot of times , \[ i- , \+ if \] they go straight into college I think 0 they 're going in too quick E_S

13197:8	I think particular boys that the maturity , N_S
13199:10	and I think 0 \[ there 's a , \+ there 's a \] real challenge there . E_S
13200:65	There 's also \[ this , \+ this \] issue \[ of , \+ of , \] uh , you know , whether you 're really ready , E_S
13201:10	and I think 0 it gives a different perspective . E_S
13205:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 if you 've been out of school a \[ year , \+ year \] and a half , before you start to college , you appreciate college more , than someone that *T*-1 just goes right straight into college . E_S
13212:48	There are , uh , some groups that *T*-1 have their children , you know , go away for a year . E_S
13216:8	I think 0 the Mormon church \[ has , \+ sends \] out missionaries that , N_S
13223:42	although the kids today , though , \[ it , \+ it \] seems \[ that \+ almost that \] their concern for money , N_S
13228:10	do you think 0 that would be reasonable ? E_S
13230:8	I think 0 it would *?* . E_S
13231:110	\[ In , \+ in \] Israel , \[ the , \+ even the \] women \[ are , \+ are \] required *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] be in the military for a certain period of time . E_S

13254:27	I do n't know if you \[ know , \+ remember \] about the W P A , E_S
13260:20	I mean , you know , uh , it 's not the best thing in the world , E_S
13263:13	Well , it seems that there 's some things like \[ the , \+ uh , the \] programs at least just go around \[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ and \] clean up streets \[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ and \] pick up trash and even aluminum cans and some of these kinds of things . E_S
13279:8	I think that , uh , N_S
13300:13	Well , I think , uh , N_S
13303:38	but I have n't had that much time 0 * to think about it *T*-1 , either . E_S
13304:114	I guess 0 the , uh , biggest thing 0 I \[ f- , \+ find *T*-1 \] is the financial aspects , uh , particularly , the ability *ICH*-2 of people * to access , you know , your financial records or , for example your credit , uh , rating almost at will . E_S
13313:13	I did n't think about that . E_S
13324:11	I just thought about it , E_S
13325:42	*-1 being a professional \[ and , \+ \] of course , you probably belong to one or more professional organizations , E_S
13326:50	and that is that N_S some of the organizations sell their mailing lists which I think 0 *T*-1 \[ is a , \+ is an \] invasion of privacy . E_S
13345:57	and you wonder , well , who *T*-1 's going *-2 to get ahold of this and think , um , that 's a nice place 0 * to go *-3 rob *T*-4 . E_S
13365:50	I 've had them \[ for , \+ of course , for , \] you know , real estate investments E_S
13369:10	you know , you get , uh , * please send in \[ your , \+ uh , you know , this \] particular card
13369:63	you know , you get , uh , * please send in \[ your , \+ uh , you know , this \] particular card
13374:147	And so , \[ that , \+ uh , that \] bothers me because \[ I , \+ of course , I \] enjoy *-1 being at home and I do not enjoy *-2 getting called *-3 by strangers uh , particularly \[ solicit- , \+ you know , soliciting . \] E_S
13379:10	and I know that a lot of these , of course , are random phone calls E_S
13383:18	they just , you know , start *-1 going through the phone book or going through a series of numbers , E_S
13385:10	and I know 0 you N_S
13394:10	you know , \[ my , \+ my \] office address . E_S
13398:27	But they have one under , you know , my first name , James . E_S
13414:10	So I know that they have sold their mailing list . E_S
13418:17	And , uh , I think 0 those two things bother me more than anything else as far as an invasion of privacy . E_S
13422:25	And , uh , I ca n't really think of anything else *ICH*-1 offhand , that , uh , N_S
13424:8	I think 0 I dislike the phone number part the worst . E_S
13427:14	and , you know , usually when they call you *T*-1 , it 's going *-2 to be \[ when you s- , \+ right when you sit \] down to dinner *T*-3 because \[ they know , \+ they pretty much know \] that you 're at work all day E_S
13427:121	and , you know , usually when they call you *T*-1 , it 's going *-2 to be \[ when you s- , \+ right when you sit \] down to dinner *T*-3 because \[ they know , \+ they pretty much know \] that you 're at work all day E_S
13427:137	and , you know , usually when they call you *T*-1 , it 's going *-2 to be \[ when you s- , \+ right when you sit \] down to dinner *T*-3 because \[ they know , \+ they pretty much know \] that you 're at work all day E_S
13429:54	The last thing 0 you want *T*-1 is a phone call unless it 's , you know , something halfway enjoyable , E_S
13435:29	and I 'm just assuming 0 it 's probably a salesman that *T*-1 called during the day E_S
13437:13	and they 'll probably call me up and , you know , call me back and bother me when I sit down to dinner later on *T*-1 , E_S
13437:35	and they 'll probably call me up and , you know , call me back and bother me when I sit down to dinner later on *T*-1 , E_S
13443:10	you know , E_S it 's kind of irritating , E_S
13446:13	\[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 you mentioning the phone calls during dinner , E_S
13446:24	\[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 you mentioning the phone calls during dinner , E_S
13449:8	I know 0 when I sit down with the family and want *-1 to have the opportunity , \[ you know , \+ \] * to talk and see what *T*-2 's going on and all those things *T*-3 , E_S
13449:68	I know 0 when I sit down with the family and want *-1 to have the opportunity , \[ you know , \+ \] * to talk and see what *T*-2 's going on and all those things *T*-3 , E_S
13461:44	I actually during that period of time \[ from , \+ you know , usually from \] six o'clock or six thirty , whenever I get home *T*-1 , until eight or so , I will shut off the phone E_S
13465:74	and , uh , my daughter gets irate , \[ when I , \+ when I \] do that *T*-1 because , you know , she 's a teenager E_S
13472:20	so she 'll , you know , N_S why are you cutting off the phone *T*-1 ,
13473:8	I might get an important phone call , E_S
13506:77	but now with this thing 0 I 'm participating in *T*-1 , I kind of have *-2 to answer it , because you never know if it 's the switchboard or if it 's , uh , you know , somebody calling that you really do n't want *-3 to talk on the phone . E_S
13506:120	but now with this thing 0 I 'm participating in *T*-1 , I kind of have *-2 to answer it , because you never know if it 's the switchboard or if it 's , uh , you know , somebody calling that you really do n't want *-3 to talk on the phone . E_S
13508:46	Well \[ I have , \+ now we have \] a , you know , voice mail system \[ at , \+ uh , at \] the office . E_S
13529:60	\[ And , \+ uh , or \] I will just let the phone ring three or four times and know that it will forward \[ to , \+ uh , to \] the office . E_S
13533:31	And so \[ it 's , \+ you know , it \] makes it convenient . E_S
13534:30	But at the office when I , you know , N_S
13540:55	And \[ when I , \+ when I \] want *-1 to be , you know , not bothered *-4 during the day *T*-3 , that 's exactly what I do *T*-2 . E_S
13546:16	Well , yours is probably the same as ours . E_S
13605:18	Oh , Dana , I think 0 we have probably conversed long enough . E_S
13605:31	Oh , Dana , I think 0 we have probably conversed long enough . E_S
13607:8	I think 0 we did , E_S
13615:13	I did n't think 0 we could go too far on this privacy thing , E_S
13635:67	and therefore , *-1 having seen the last generation , I guess 0 it \[ puts me in , \+ you know , gives me \] a perspective on that . E_S
13644:16	Uh , now I think 0 the change that I 've seen *T*-1 as much as anything is one where couples , uh , are more carefully planning their intention on how *-3 to both share homemaking duties *T*-4 and also how women will , uh , have their children and then deliberately sort of plan how they go back to the work place *T*-6 *T*-5 *T*-2 . E_S
13656:43	Uh , I have wondered why they allowed , or let , you know , both the father and mother go *T*-1 , uh , E_S
13670:136	So , \[ \[ I , \+ I do n't , \] \+ \[ I , \+ I \] guess \] 0 we 'll have *-1 to see another generation *-2 to see what differences a child being brought *T*-3 up , you know , in \[ a , \+ uh , kind of a , \] uh , community , rather than a home . E_S
13679:33	\[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 one knows one 's own storly E_S
13680:10	and I know , uh , 0 in my children 's case it was one where , uh , pretty much up until the older of two was \[ in , \+ \] uh , * let 's see , I guess basically starting junior high E_S and the younger was in fifth grade when my wife reentered the work force *T*-2 . E_S
13700:18	uh , I do n't know whether there will be an increased amount \[ of , \+ of \] surrogacy that we see *T*-1 . E_S
13701:16	I just do n't know . E_S
13710:29	\[ * to be , \+ you know , * not to be \] crass about it , but , uh , uh , whether one might conceive , no pun intended , of the possibility that there might be a kind of \[ a deliberate , \+ uh , uh a professional \] mother , \[ a- , \+ \] person . For instance , that , N_S

13730:28	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't think 0 I have a philosophical problem with that . E_S
13731:16	In fact , I think 0 it sort of raises nurturing and * being a mother to what it ought *-3 to be *T*-1 which *T*-2 is a respected profession . E_S
13737:18	Uh , \[ I know \[ that , \+ that \] \+ my sense is that \] I have very much an interest *RNR*-2 and had one *RNR*-2 in *-1 being a parent . E_S
13738:28	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't know that I , uh , felt myself necessarily encumbered *-1 with the necessity * to have heirs . E_S
13759:13	Uh , I know that there are young people , characterized * , I guess as * being half my age , so \[ that \+ by definition that \] means , 0 they 're young .

13783:34	Uh , I have acquaintances of mine where I know that they are paying figures \[ on , \+ on \] the order of what I quoted *T*-1 to someone , because that 's \[ what \+ \] the experience 0 they want *T*-2 *T*-3 E_S
13789:13	And then you might have more control over , uh , \[ the , \+ the \] morals that they would be taught *-1 *T*-2 rather than in like a classroom or a day care center . E_S
13794:8	I know 0 the day care centers are not cheap either . E_S
13795:10	You know they 're , N_S
13803:16	\[ I just know , \+ I know \] several single mothers who *T*-1 absolutely ca n't afford it . E_S

13816:28	I mean , that is , you know , just \[ a , \+ a \] rate that you have *-1 to pay *T*-2 E_S
13821:13	Uh , I think , 0 I really do n't have a vision . E_S
13826:38	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] think that they will be more in the work place because , uh , the door 's open . E_S

13890:28	Well , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 it 's a pretty good idea . E_S

13898:10	and I think that before we expend all our young talent overseas \[ and , \+ and \] *-1 helping other countries we ought *-2 to perhaps give a little bit of our help to our own folks at home E_S

13916:125	Because when I was in the Girl Scouts *T*-1 , we did a lot of public service things , because that 's just part \[ \[ o- , \+ of , \] \+ of \] the scouting , and , you know . N_S
13921:26	\[ I , \+ I \] really think that both the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts is \[ a excellent , \+ two excellent \] organizations . E_S
13926:10	You know , kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old *T*-1 they fall out of that , E_S
13926:18	You know , kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old *T*-1 they fall out of that , E_S
13931:33	and they do n't follow it at all , you know . E_S
13936:29	\[ And , \+ and \] I do n't know what the high rank *ICH*-2 is *T*-1 for the gals E_S
13972:8	I think 0 it 's a really a good thing . E_S
13974:26	of course , there 's , you know , third world countries that *T*-1 can use all kind of help . E_S
13979:10	But I think , 0 we ought *-1 to start right here at home . E_S
13982:18	I 'm , you know , N_S
13985:41	uh , \[ I 'm not , \+ I 'm not \] so sure that \[ overseas help , \+ * helping overseas \] would be such a hot idea \[ for , \+ for , \] uh , a lot of young \[ k- , \+ people . \] E_S

14106:172	Well , I had heard a couple of people , you know , that I had talked to *T*-1 about certain programs say that , you know , they had read other things besides what SIXTY MINUTES presented *T*-2 and that they did n't present it nearly the same way as the , you know , news articles or whatever 0 \[ they had , \+ they had \] already been familiar with *T*-3 . E_S
14110:18	\[ I do n't know di- , \+ I do n't know how \] old you are *T*-1 , E_S
14110:37	\[ I do n't know di- , \+ I do n't know how \] old you are *T*-1 , E_S
14111:10	but it seems to me like the last , uh , newscaster that *T*-1 presented news in just the nice simple factual way that I wanted *-2 to hear *T*-3 was Walter Cronkite . E_S
14115:38	So , \[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] know if you 're familiar with him or not . E_S
14118:17	not really , you know , E_S
14147:14	What did you think *T*-1 of the news coverage of the war ? E_S
14158:30	and I do n't need their fill-ins , you know . E_S
14164:25	but \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 it helps me everyday in *-1 trying *-2 to review \[ wh- , \+ \] the state that the world is in *T*-3 and try *-2 to guess where we 're going *T*-4 . E_S
14166:87	I wondered if it would help 0 you sometimes fill in the gaps or recognize discrepancies that \[ other people , \+ people like myself \] might not pick up on *T*-1 . E_S
14168:28	Well , \[ I , \+ I \] think , uh , 0 my background is probably what *T*-1 absolutely turned me off with SIXTY MINUTES . E_S
14168:50	Well , \[ I , \+ I \] think , uh , 0 my background is probably what *T*-1 absolutely turned me off with SIXTY MINUTES . E_S
14179:8	I believe in *-1 giving anything a chance . E_S
14194:16	and there 's maybe a page of that , little brief paragraphs , unless that was \[ one of their , \+ the focus of their \] main stories . E_S
14209:13	And it just seems *-1 to fit nicely , so that I can get it read *-2 in about three days . E_S
14212:35	for the last couple of months we got , you know , an introductory subscription , E_S
14216:37	Well , * to broaden your horizons , make 0 you think about different things anyway . E_S
14220:26	Well , anytime that we stop and think *T*-1 it ca n't hurt . E_S
14228:14	Because , you know , we do n't listen to the radio at work at all . E_S
14244:29	So , that can give you , you know , current news updates , current weather updates , things like that E_S
14255:5	maybe our phone company out here will get around to , *-1 offering something like that . E_S
14259:27	So , that is something 0 you might keep your eyes open for *T*-1 , E_S
14260:8	I think 0 \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] catching on throughout the country . E_S
14266:14	Who do you think *T*-1 ? E_S
14281:20	I mean , you know . N_S
14283:23	Well I mean , you know , I think , uh , 0 once Jimmy Johnson gets his system established *-1 , uh , they 'll do all right . E_S
14283:31	Well I mean , you know , I think , uh , 0 once Jimmy Johnson gets his system established *-1 , uh , they 'll do all right . E_S
14291:42	So , \[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] even know who your favorite team is *T*-1 , actually . E_S
14296:8	I think 0 I did know that ,
14296:21	I think 0 I did know that ,
14311:16	well I do n't know , E_S
14313:13	I do n't know , E_S
14318:40	Well , \[ he could always get past , \+ you know , he 'd get past \] like six or seven tackles and just keep *-1 spinning around and get on into the end zone . E_S
14322:17	But , I do n't know . E_S
14344:13	I 'm not sure . E_S
14349:54	but since it 's kind of off season , it *EXP*-1 's kind of hard * to think back about all that . E_S
14353:18	there 's , you know , Mike MUMBLEx , N_S Minnesota Vikings , 0 *T*-1 used *-2 to be the general manager starting the World Football League . E_S
14358:16	I ca n't even think of the guy 's *ICH*-1 name , either , the coach of the Vikings . E_S
14368:22	but , uh , I do n't know , E_S
14388:11	Except I think 0 the Cowboys are on the upswing . E_S
14389:13	I do n't know about the Vikings . E_S
14403:13	I do n't know . N_S
14404:8	I think 0 the Cowboys probably have \[ a , \+ a \] better team . E_S
14404:20	I think 0 the Cowboys probably have \[ a , \+ a \] better team . E_S
14415:33	Because \[ now , \+ now , \] you know , he had a shot \[ and , \+ and \] did n't look too good E_S
14420:16	In fact , I think 0 they 're getting a different guy for a backup quarterback . E_S
14435:13	I do n't know . E_S
14437:8	I think 0 it was *?* . E_S
14439:13	\[ I think 0 it , \+ I think 0 it \] was his shoulder 0 he had surgery on *T*-1 . E_S
14439:31	\[ I think 0 it , \+ I think 0 it \] was his shoulder 0 he had surgery on *T*-1 . E_S
14440:48	But anyway , they 're trying *-1 to \[ keep him , \+ you know , keep him , \] uh , from *-2 reinjuring anything ,
14452:13	but I just thought 0 I 'd throw that in there . E_S
14456:5	maybe I 'll call you back \[ after , \+ after \] the recording is finished *-1 . E_S
14457:11	Actually I think 0 we have talked about football for five minutes . E_S
14471:55	so I guess 0 we should talk about football a little bit longer just *-1 to be sure 0 we got five minutes in . E_S
14473:15	* Make * sure 0 we get our cash flow . E_S
14491:18	Um , I do n't know who else I 've ever . N_S
14494:8	I think 0 I was into the Cardinals for a little bit E_S
14505:31	Other than that , I mean , you know , \[ when I 've , \+ you know , when you \] grow up in a city that *T*-1 has \[ the , \+ you know , one of the \] greatest football teams until the last few years *T*-2 , you kind of tend *-3 to get caught *-4 up in it . E_S
14505:62	Other than that , I mean , you know , \[ when I 've , \+ you know , when you \] grow up in a city that *T*-1 has \[ the , \+ you know , one of the \] greatest football teams until the last few years *T*-2 , you kind of tend *-3 to get caught *-4 up in it . E_S

14521:12	and you know , the hype were just unbelievable . E_S
14522:21	It 's just , you know , the last , oh N_S
14523:15	I guess 0 probably since about eighty-four , about eighty-five was when they started *-1 kind of going downhill really *T*-2 , E_S
14524:14	but , you know , I 'm just used to *-1 always growing up and hearing Cowboys , Cowboys , Cowboys , and , you know , Super Bowl , and all this other stuff . E_S
14524:76	but , you know , I 'm just used to *-1 always growing up and hearing Cowboys , Cowboys , Cowboys , and , you know , Super Bowl , and all this other stuff . E_S
14525:24	So , I ca n't , you know , N_S
14527:18	I mean , I think 0 they 'll pull out of it , E_S
14528:14	and , you know , \[ they 'll , \+ they 'll \] wind up *-1 being good again . E_S
14529:122	They 've got \[ some , \+ lot \] of really good young players \[ that *T*-1 are going *-2 to , \+ that *T*-3 are going *-4 to , \] uh , do pretty good , I think 0 *T*-5 . E_S
14532:8	I think 0 tickets are , N_S
14557:15	Um , you know , I 'm not sure , E_S
14557:28	Um , you know , I 'm not sure , E_S
14559:37	\[ I did n't , \+ I did n't \] really think about that . E_S
14569:27	But that was n't a real , you know , N_S
14571:32	\[ it was kind of , \+ you know , it was kind of \] different , I guess 0 *T*-1 . E_S
14575:7	So maybe this year MUMBLEx . N_S
14612:20	Fernando , glad * to know you . E_S
14651:23	so , uh , what do you think , that , uh , N_S
14652:52	\[ \[ what do , \+ what do , \] \+ what do \] you think 0 we can do *T*-1 * to solve the crime in America ? E_S
14660:61	\[ I , \+ the way 0 I \] look at it *T*-1 , you have *-2 to think first of all why , E_S
14664:106	Well , see the problem \[ is , \+ is \] that , um , what *T*-1 happens is \[ as , \+ \] that \[ you 're , \+ uh , you know , as you \] go from the country to a city , crime always increases , right ? E_S
14681:98	and what we have *-1 to do *T*-2 is , 0 we have *-3 to go , uh , *-4 get some stuff , steal it , and then , you know , just resell it . E_S
14692:10	And that certainly is one reason why crime here has increased *T*-1 . E_S
14694:58	\[ That 's , \+ uh , that 's , \] uh , the main reason 0 I think , uh , everywhere *T*-1 E_S
14697:20	and you have , you know , people stealing other people 's stuff , E_S
14704:46	I mean , the thing \[ is \+ is \] that , you know , it 's like you might be standing somewhere , right , E_S
14704:65	I mean , the thing \[ is \+ is \] that , you know , it 's like you might be standing somewhere , right , E_S
14705:82	and like * let 's say 0 \[ \[ \[ you , \+ you 're , \] \+ you 're , \] \+ you know , you 're \] driving out E_S
14708:33	And you stop by one of these , you know , twenty-four hour , you know , gas stations joints . E_S
14708:50	And you stop by one of these , you know , twenty-four hour , you know , gas stations joints . E_S
14719:14	that 's for sure . E_S
14725:17	Well , but you know , \[ the , \+ the \] \[ strange thing , \+ uh , perhaps , not strange , but something that many people do n't realize *T*-1 , \] is that you can go back as far as nineteen fifty-one and fifty-two and find that there were drug dealers at that time trying *-2 to influence the high school kids , E_S
14738:67	\[ there 's a , \+ there 's \[ a , \+ uh , a \] \] song that I know *T*-1 which *T*-2 says , you know , tha- , N_S

14740:26	and , uh , their figures , I think 0 *T*-1 are \[ too , \+ so \] N_S
14741:45	I mean it 's like , \[ compared to , \+ you know , compared to , \] weapons or stuff like that , I mean , you 're spending nothing \[ on , \+ on \] crime in the country itself . E_S
14742:41	What you 're doing *T*-1 is , 0 you , you know , N_S
14743:35	it 's like , you have other things , you know , E_S
14745:72	we 're going *-1 to solve , try *-2 to solve the AIDS problem \[ while , \+ while , \] you know , some people are getting killed *-3 here and there E_S
14752:73	and another one of the problems is that the people who *T*-1 are the dealers , the big dealers in drugs , \[ may be , \+ may be \] part of the power structure that *T*-2 's keeping us from * spending the money in that direction . E_S
14752:84	and another one of the problems is that the people who *T*-1 are the dealers , the big dealers in drugs , \[ may be , \+ may be \] part of the power structure that *T*-2 's keeping us from * spending the money in that direction . E_S
14773:10	You know , it 's like , N_S
14774:24	of course , I mean I might be , you know , \[ the \+ the \] leading drug dealer here , E_S
14774:37	of course , I mean I might be , you know , \[ the \+ the \] leading drug dealer here , E_S
14776:66	I mean , there 's no connection between me and the people that *T*-1 were caught *-2 , you know . E_S
14783:15	one person does n't know the other person down the line . E_S
14791:11	because it sure is monstrous in this country . E_S
14807:10	You know , and he goes , yeah , I just came up here * to work , E_S
14811:18	he goes , you know . E_S
14815:4	might . E_S
14824:64	and within , uh , two months , he has all his house payments gone * everything paid * , you know , E_S
14828:32	and he had enough money * to , you know , N_S
14829:39	it 's like , those guys , at one point , you know , they had so much money that they did n't know what * to do *T*-1 with it . E_S

14832:15	really , you know , E_S
14876:50	It 's one 0 we all hold *T*-1 dear and near , I 'm sure 0 *T*-2 . E_S
14889:75	Well , I do fairly good until I go in the store and I see something 0 I want *T*-1 . You know not need *T*-1 , want *T*-1 . E_S
14916:13	Oh , it sure is *?* especially when you work out of town and everything , that way *T*-1 . E_S
14940:10	You know , \[ I just , \+ I 'm just \] shocked *ICH*-3 at the end of the month , *-1 to see what damage I have did *T*-2 , E_S

14957:38	they 're there when you need them *T*-1 . You know , like in emergencies , or whatever . E_S
14978:8	That seems *-1 to be a pretty low interest .
14992:33	Uh , we used *-1 to have , you know , like several , E_S
14993:45	but right now , we 're just more or less at American Express , you know , E_S
15011:8	I know , E_S
15016:35	And when you pay fifteen dollars a month *T*-1 it sure takes a long time . E_S
15021:8	It sure does . E_S
15023:83	And now without the benefits of * being able *-1 to deduct interest \[ off , \+ off \] your income tax that 's , you know . N_S
15040:7	And maybe we 'll get *-1 to talk again . E_S
15052:14	that 's for sure . E_S
15053:13	Um , I know 0 I have n't done any Peace Corps service , E_S

15161:11	I 'd probably catch a terrible disease and die . E_S

15168:106	\[ W- , \+ I , \] I mean , \[ it would , \+ it *EXP*-2 would \] have *-1 to be tough * going somewhere 0 you do n't know the culture *T*-3 , usually , I guess 0 *T*-4 . E_S
15172:8	I think that maybe that 's why some people do it *T*-1 is , uh , * to see the other cultures \[ or , \+ you know and \] some of that . E_S
15172:16	I think that maybe that 's why some people do it *T*-1 is , uh , * to see the other cultures \[ or , \+ you know and \] some of that . E_S

15182:77	MUMBLEx * Growing up , all 0 I knew *T*-1 was you go to high school , \[ you , \+ you know , you \] work , you go to college , you get out of college , and you get a good job and you work . E_S

15185:33	Uh-huh . Well , you know , uh , I know American Express , N_S
15188:11	after a certain amount of years of service , these employees can take off like six months or something , for some type of sabbatical or \[ \[ some , \+ you know , some , \] \+ something \] like that . E_S

15196:27	So , it is something that I think , uh , you know , 0 even the larger organizations will support *T*-1 . E_S
15196:42	So , it is something that I think , uh , you know , 0 even the larger organizations will support *T*-1 . E_S
15197:68	Uh , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] really for the community \[ * to give , you know , * \[ to , \+ to \] give \] back to the community type of thing . E_S

15215:5	maybe a little bit in that perspective , E_S
15216:69	\[ but , \+ uh , and \] a lot of people have gone in the military , I mean , you know , when they 're in the college *T*-1 . E_S

15221:32	Uh , \[ others , \+ people \] do n't know what they want *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S

15439:13	Oh , I thought 0 it was great . E_S
15445:26	Now , I 've seen , you know , some different clips of it , um , E_S
15451:36	\[ there 's a , \+ there 's a \] certain scene in the movie \[ where there 's , \+ um , where \[ they 're , \+ they 're \] \] on a buffalo hunt *T*-1 . E_S

15514:50	And they should have taken them out and rolled them in the dirt a little more probably * \[ to age , \+ to age \] the material E_S
15527:51	but \[ they did n't , \+ they did n't \] age it quite enough it seemed 0 *T*-1 . E_S
15542:8	I think 0 the last movie 0 I saw *T*-1 was MISERY . E_S
15552:30	and once I was there , I could n't believe . E_S
15559:13	I was n't sure , E_S

15566:8	I think 0 I heard somebody talking about that

15580:28	\[ and , \+ but , \] you know , you could tell when it was coming *T*-1 . E_S

15656:13	I do n't think 0 I could *?* . E_S
15658:8	I think , uh , N_S
15664:12	So , it might not be as , N_S
15665:8	I think 0 they may be playing up um , some aspects of the movie that *T*-1 are n't the main aspects . E_S
15665:18	I think 0 they may be playing up um , some aspects of the movie that *T*-1 are n't the main aspects . E_S

15709:16	Uh , because I know that , uh , in *-1 using drugs I was not a good employee . E_S
15736:28	Do they do it , like , you know , within hours of the accident , E_S
15745:13	I do n't know if it 's been a deterrent or not , because we have , uh , just started *-1 using it oh , for the past year or so . E_S
15753:18	Now , I do n't know how T E C would handle it *T*-1 . E_S
15754:26	They have n't pursued it , you know . E_S
15758:35	Uh , if there 's some , uh , problem I know , N_S
15768:10	So I think 0 the tests themselves are not really that cut and dried , you know . E_S

15774:8	I think 0 that 's probably true , too . E_S

15812:63	some of the places *ICH*-1 now , um , like I B M do n't allow them smoking , you know \[ in , \+ in \] the plant . E_S

15926:47	And I was losing jobs just from *-1 doing a poor job , you know . E_S
15932:20	I mean , you know , there 's all kinds of drawbacks , much less the drug testing . E_S
15945:14	Plus , you know , \[ you , \+ you \] want *-1 to think \[ that , \+ that \] you 're working with people who *T*-2 are not only putting out their fair share , but that *T*-3 are not endangering your life , E_S

16020:53	And she said , Oh , he 's the supervisor of this chemical land fill , you know where they go and dump all this toxic stuff *T*-1 . E_S

16132:72	\[ I wo n't make , \+ I wo n't have \] a sharp cheddar because \[ it , \+ for fondue I think 0 it \] should be a little calmer than real sharp , cheddar . E_S

16148:18	I mean , I think 0 they like *-1 to have healthy stuff too , E_S

16236:22	\[ ther- , \+ you know , if you get a sweet strawberry they 're \] much better , E_S

16323:8	I think 0 they 're real reasonably priced , E_S
16329:53	and you beat this cornstarch right into \[ the mil- , \+ the milk , \] you know , E_S
16333:20	but \[ I do n't think 0 it pur- , \+ I do n't think 0 it gets \] it good enough . E_S

16343:48	when it thickens *T*-1 the cornstarch might get a little , I do n't know , N_S
16352:21	you 'd have *-1 to probably almost go out E_S
16432:8	I think 0 you could n't make it with a hand whisk \[ or , \+ or \] a regular beater E_S
16435:11	It would probably be a lot more work and probably not turn out as good . E_S
16435:31	It would probably be a lot more work and probably not turn out as good . E_S
16438:13	but I still think 0 a beater would do it good enough , um , E_S
16448:8	It seems *-1 to be better than * putting \[ the , \+ the \] cornstarch into the liquid E_S
16449:47	\[ it , \+ once it \] hits the top of the liquid it seems *-1 to make little balls and stuff on the top . E_S
16462:17	And then , you know , if you can put your cocoa in with your cornstarch if you wanted *-1 to *?* . The cocoa even seems *-2 to thicken it even more . E_S
16462:81	And then , you know , if you can put your cocoa in with your cornstarch if you wanted *-1 to *?* . The cocoa even seems *-2 to thicken it even more . E_S
16466:21	Because by the vanilla does n't seem *-1 to thicken as well as the , N_S
16473:155	Because I 'm always worrying 0 it wo n't firm up because \[ it , \+ when you take it \] out of the saucepan *T*-1 it 's like , boy , I hope 0 this thickens a little more because it 's not like real package thick , you know , E_S
16486:10	and I might put it back on . E_S
16513:23	So , well , I do n't know E_S
16516:21	I was trying *-1 to think about some of my favorite people that I liked *T*-2 in music E_S

16543:13	I do n't know . E_S

16742:40	\[ I , \+ I \] like mostly the older groups I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S

16820:26	East Texas is recruiting for , you know , their fall semester E_S

16947:58	and if you 're trying *-1 to hold out , you know , there 's so much pressure on you E_S
16952:32	and it 's like , do you really feel that sure about , N_S
16970:10	but it seems as though if you really want *-2 to set \[ a t- , \+ \] side time 0 * to read the Bible *T*-1 and you work \[ and \+ and \] whatever , uh , that pretty well takes up your time for reading . E_S
16988:70	Uh , a lot of times I do just read magazines and stuff like that \[ for , \+ \] you know , because I do n't have a lot of time , E_S
16995:37	And , uh , I like *-1 to read , you know , Bi- , N_S
17078:29	And it also teaches them spiritual warfare you know , E_S
17090:92	and I like that because \[ it 's a , \+ it 's \] real easy 0 * to , uh , follow *T*-1 for her , E_S you know , uh ,
17106:8	I know it , E_S
17116:8	it sure is *?* , E_S
17125:78	but then on the other extreme I like *-1 to read , uh , uh , \[ I guess ho- , \+ I do n't know , horror , \] Steven King type books . E_S
17154:15	well N_S you know when you 're recording *T*-1 you ca n't \[ re- , \+ remem- , \] N_S
17156:8	I know . E_S
17166:8	I know her . E_S
17188:8	I know that . E_S
17191:13	oh , I think 0 I know who you 're talking about *T*-1 . E_S
17191:23	oh , I think 0 I know who you 're talking about *T*-1 . E_S
17193:13	I do n't think 0 I can pronounce it either , E_S
17200:10	and I think 0 I 've seen his books in there . E_S
17208:8	It seems like it 's all the , N_S
17217:8	I know it . E_S
17218:10	And that seems like all of his books have kind of come from that , I mean . E_S
17223:10	You know , that , N_S
17228:8	I thought 0 it was great . E_S
17243:53	Whenever \[ they \+ , they \] made that into a movie *T*-1 , I was thinking oh , my gosh if they show that , I 'll just die . E_S
17250:28	he just brings stuff alive , you know . E_S
17263:8	I think 0 they did a pretty good job , E_S
17268:33	but they did \[ give it , \+ you know , do it \] justice . E_S
17334:8	I know it . E_S
17350:13	uh , I think 0 his name was Bachman . E_S
17365:13	Oh , I know it . E_S
17376:10	you know , the l- , N_S
17385:42	So it *EXP*-1 's kind of hard * to keep , you know , at it , E_S
17412:26	oh , N_S gosh why ca n't I think of their names *T*-1 , E_S
17426:18	Uh , well , you know who I 'm talking about *T*-1 . E_S
17443:107	That 's why I like *-1 to watch that MASTERPIECE THEATRE on channel thirteen *T*-2 , because they 'll take a classic \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , televise it you know , put it into a viewing format , more or less . E_S
17458:8	I know 0 \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] really hard for me . E_S
17474:13	Well , I think 0 we 've accomplished five minutes E_S
17477:8	I think 0 we have *?* , too . E_S
17523:23	it 's , uh , you know , afterwards , you know , E_S
17523:38	it 's , uh , you know , afterwards , you know , E_S
17524:51	then you have *-1 to take a shower and get cleaned *-2 up , you know . E_S
17540:13	I do n't know if you 've seen those advertised *-1 on T V . E_S
17578:10	so * thought I , \[ better , \+ better \] *-1 get outside and do something and not waist the day . E_S
17597:30	Well , I do n't job enough I think 0 *T*-1 * to develop any injuries E_S
17600:115	I guess 0 it *EXP*-3 worries me about jogging \[ 0 it 's \+ \] that I hear that it 's very hard on your body \[ and , \+ and \] that , you know , you can end up *-1 getting hurt *-2 , worse . E_S
17638:46	I get into that \[ for , \+ for \] a little while and maybe go out , uh , on a consistent basis every couple of days and ride a bike for awhile , E_S
17639:40	but then I 'll get tired of *-1 doing that , and maybe start *-1 jogging again and go out about three or four nights a week . E_S
17687:22	but , uh , it 's a thought . E_S
17749:22	and this does n't , you know , N_S
17751:14	and , you know , you can get a really good workout on it . E_S
17793:13	I do n't know if he 's still on any more or not , E_S
17794:32	\[ I don- , \+ I do n't \] know if I get E S P N or not . E_S
17798:24	But , uh , one , you know , N_S
17802:66	BODIES IN MOTION \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] the name of the one 0 I was thinking of *T*-1 .
17831:35	But then that was back when , uh , you know , the high impact and , N_S
17852:23	It 's , uh , you know , N_S
17882:18	Now , that 's a thought . E_S
17888:16	Well , that 's thought , E_S
17889:13	I have n't thought about that , E_S
17893:13	well , I sure enjoyed , to you about exercise and fitness . E_S
17926:8	You know ? E_S
17940:8	I know 0 we do n't have enough prisons , E_S
17975:8	You know ? E_S
17977:13	Well , they certainly are living \[ off our ex- , \+ at our expense . \] E_S
17979:13	Uh , they sure are *?* just because , some innocent person , can really , N_S
17985:8	it seems like , really MUMBLEx a rough time N_S
17989:8	you know ?
17992:10	You know , \[ it seems like \+ when they go to prison *T*-1 , it , \[ they \+ \] really seem like \] it 's a rough time for them E_S

18004:196	One thing 0 I really hate *T*-1 , is 0 they do n't explain to the jurors , \[ \[ in a , \+ in a \] trial , \+ in a capital murder trial , \] or in cases of rape , or in different things that *T*-2 are so horrible , what it means *T*-3 when they sentence them to , you know , N_S
18005:56	they 'll sentence them to ninety years and say \[ that it 's , \+ you know , that it 's \] going *-1 to , you know , N_S
18005:90	they 'll sentence them to ninety years and say \[ that it 's , \+ you know , that it 's \] going *-1 to , you know , N_S
18011:119	*-2 given *-1 the choice of * either sentencing to death , or sentencing to life , they 'll give them ninety years in prison or something , and then turn around in thirty years , that , you know , N_S
18018:50	and then they get an appeal that *T*-1 says 0 it was , you know , an unjust amount of time , an extraordinary long length , or something . E_S
18026:53	I would love *-1 to see them just really get real strict on parole you know . E_S
18032:8	I think 0 people know \[ that nobody , \+ that it does n't , \] you know , N_S
18032:18	I think 0 people know \[ that nobody , \+ that it does n't , \] you know , N_S
18032:59	I think 0 people know \[ that nobody , \+ that it does n't , \] you know , N_S
18037:24	There 's should be , you know , \[ this , \+ for this \] crime , this is the penalty . E_S
18038:22	You killed , someone you know , in cold blood or whatever . E_S
18056:33	\[ and , \+ but , \] I , do n't know what else * to do *T*-1 with some of these people , that *T*-2 are , N_S
18062:23	\[ I , \+ I \] know . E_S
18087:30	Uh , a lot of people really does n't think that much about it , because it has n't happened to them , which *T*-1 it has n't *?* to me either ,
18088:8	you know ? E_S
18095:8	I know , E_S
18106:36	And as far as the other states , I honestly do n't know what their capital punishment is *T*-1 . E_S
18107:10	You know , \[ I , \+ I , \] have n't kept up , you know , anything , like that . E_S
18107:54	You know , \[ I , \+ I , \] have n't kept up , you know , anything , like that . E_S
18112:13	\[ I think \+ I think \] 0 \[ Texas is wha- , \+ Texas , \] the southern states seem *-1 to be somewhat more conservative and still have the death penalty , E_S

18115:26	and \[ I think , \+ I know \] 0 California had it for a long time , E_S
18126:47	some of them , like Manson who *T*-1 's come up you know N_S
18141:20	I mean , you know N_S
18150:8	You know ? E_S
18154:8	It seems like a lot of times the law \[ is , \+ is \] totally on the criminal side , \[ and , \+ and \] is n't protecting the rest of the people . E_S
18157:24	The victim is really , * seems like *T*-3 *ICH*-2 left *-1 out in the cold , more or less , does n't it , E_S
18161:89	\[ in a lot of , \+ well , especially in things , \] 0 you pick up the paper , E_S and you read *T*-1 , you know , you think , oh my goodness E_S

18168:148	Some of the things that * *EXP*-1 would make sense * \[ to , \+ to \] tell the jury *T*-2 , that \[ this , \+ this \] guy has \[ a , \+ a \] prior \[ cri- , \+ criminal \] history , you know , where he 's raped ten women *T*-3 N_S
18177:37	and so they say , well , this is , you know , N_S
18178:28	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't know if they say 0 it 's the first time offense or whatever , E_S
18179:29	but they give him a lighter sentence , *-1 thinking 0 he 's not a habitual criminal . E_S
18181:14	Or , you know , * plead insanity . E_S
18185:10	You know . And a lots of things . E_S
18192:10	But that seems *-1 to be a good way 0 * to get off *T*-2 for a lot of them too . E_S
18211:8	I know , 0 \[ in , \+ in \] the Dallas metroplex area , I do n't go out hardly if I do n't have *-1 to *?* at night by myself E_S
18215:31	and \[ \[ \[ I , \+ I certainly , \] \+ I , \] \+ I \] grew up in a smaller town in Texas , E_S
18219:47	Well , like I , said , I live in a small place . You know . E_S
18242:16	Well , we 're probably fixing *-1 to run out of time pretty , soon , E_S
18318:34	and then when it gets wet *T*-2 , you know , you do n't even want *-1 to get out in the yard , E_S
18327:22	But , um , I do n't know \[ what , what i- , \+ \] N_S
18341:8	I know right where that 's at *T*-1 . E_S
18344:37	\[ we 've , \+ we 've \] got \[ mayb- , \+ maybe \] eight to eight inches to a foot of soil , E_S
18344:45	\[ we 've , \+ we 've \] got \[ mayb- , \+ maybe \] eight to eight inches to a foot of soil , E_S

18406:62	\[ I just , \+ \[ I wi- , \+ \] I just \] wish 0 I 'd known \[ the , \+ , the \] variety and everything . E_S
18432:22	But , uh , I do n't know
18433:13	\[ I think 0 it 's , \+ I think 0 it \] only has about five or six more years 0 * to go *T*-1 because \[ it 's a , \+ it 's a \] really old bush , E_S

18438:15	and the roses just seem *-1 to survive just fine there . E_S
18466:34	just if you want a lot of , you know , light for underneath , that may be \[ the , \+ \] all right because \[ \[ we had , \+ because we have some , \] \+ we have some \] old fruit trees . E_S

18474:10	so we may just be getting rid *-1 of that E_S
18475:44	\[ but , \+ but \] our peaches \[ they , \+ they \] seem *-1 to be doing just fine , E_S
18480:11	It just seems like \[ they , \+ \] \[ that , \+ that \] even , you know , * pruning once a year is really not enough E_S
18480:62	It just seems like \[ they , \+ \] \[ that , \+ that \] even , you know , * pruning once a year is really not enough E_S
18486:13	I do n't know . E_S
18500:10	but I may be working like a fescue in because of , you know , the type of weather . E_S
18500:42	but I may be working like a fescue in because of , you know , the type of weather . E_S
18501:8	It seems that , uh , \[ bermuda 's , \+ bermuda 's \] fine E_S
18507:60	A lot of , \[ a lot \+ \] silt that *T*-1 comes in it just does n't seem *-2 to hold it very well . E_S
18556:39	I mean , you can see the house from , you know , miles away , E_S
18560:28	but \[ it 's , \+ you know , it 's \] a pretty neat little job E_S
18565:22	but just , uh , you know , for them , I mean , \[ they , \+ they 're \] going *-1 to have *-2 to start *-3 gardening . E_S
18589:22	And , uh , I do n't know , \[ that \+ \] what they have *T*-1 , E_S
18605:46	But , uh , \[ they 're , \+ uh , right now though I think 0 *T*-3 \[ they 're just , \+ they 're \] \] trying *-1 to get the trees planted *-2 and everything . E_S
18609:35	But , man , \[ I , \+ I \] just think of all of the money \[ that they , \+ that they 're \] going *-1 to have *-2 to spend *T*-4 *-3 just getting that . E_S
18623:8	it seem like it be just the opposite when you get , N_S
18629:56	because even though it 's far out there , it 's just that Lake Greenbelt , you know , \[ they have *-1 to , \+ \[ they , \+ they \] try *-2 to \] do it just from \[ the , \+ \] *-3 selling the water . E_S
18633:28	But , um , the water usage , you know , they try *-1 to limit *T*-3 , even though there 's three or four streams that *T*-2 flow into it ,
18644:15	but I do n't know E_S
18673:14	and , you know , we 're trying *-1 to decide \[ \[ what , \+ what \] * to , \+ what *-2 to \] put *T*-3 on one side of the house and things like that , E_S
18678:28	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't know E_S
18714:13	Uh , I think 0 that 's about where it is *T*-1 . E_S
18748:22	And \[ that , \+ I know 0 that , \] uh , brings an eighty eighty-eight machine to its knees because , I had taken it over from a friend who *T*-1 was working on it E_S
18784:18	Well , um , I seem *-1 to always be in \[ the , \+ the \] next to the last generation of word processing software . E_S
18789:13	Well , I think 0 you will be real pleased *-1 to get away from the banana 0 as I used *-2 to call it *T*-3 . E_S
18805:30	\[ I can bel- , \+ I can believe \] that . E_S

18830:11	I can believe that . E_S
18834:12	uh , E_S maybe you 'll play around some and figure out how they can help you do different things *T*-1 . E_S
18835:8	I think 0 that 's when \[ you , \+ you \] start *-1 deciding that you really need greater assets than you already have *?* *T*-2 . E_S When you start *-3 seeing what all they can do *T*-1 for you *T*-2 . E_S
18840:26	Well , I understand that , you know .
18856:15	but I did n't know 0 they had a four eighty-six just yet . E_S
18865:15	But I 'm not sure that it 's such a massive improvement . Uh , you know , E_S
18865:49	But I 'm not sure that it 's such a massive improvement . Uh , you know , E_S
18866:90	once you get passed thirty-three megahertz , all help is , kind of lost *-1 \[ in the , \+ in the \] translation . Because you no longer can think that fast anyway . E_S
18892:49	But I 'm now in Palo Alto , California which *T*-1 is , I think 0 *T*-2 , the recycling capital of the world . E_S
18908:25	but \[ it , \+ it \] seems to me that we 've gotten a whole lot better , um , cooperation out here , uh , by *-1 setting it up so that we pay just a little bit extra , uh , E_S
18909:16	actually I do n't think 0 we pay very much extra at all too , E_S
18915:8	I think 0 that 's great . E_S
18917:13	I do n't know \[ if it 's , the , \+ if they 've done it \] citywide yet *ICH*-2 or not where they have the color coded , uh , bags and , uh , bins *T*-1 . E_S
18944:82	we 've got several bins \[ in our , \+ \[ on , \+ in \] our \] garage where we , uh , you know , sort things out *T*-1 \[ and , \+ and \] take it \[ to , \+ to \] the appropriate places . E_S
18962:11	It just seems like such a waste . E_S
18966:13	But I 'm sure that they can , uh , find some sort of , uh , use for them if , you know , you know , there , N_S
18966:72	But I 'm sure that they can , uh , find some sort of , uh , use for them if , you know , you know , there , N_S
18966:82	But I 'm sure that they can , uh , find some sort of , uh , use for them if , you know , you know , there , N_S
18971:17	And so , you know , you could also apply the magazines toward that . E_S
18981:13	Oh , I know it . E_S
18993:24	And you get them for I think 0 it 's *RNR*-1 about fifty cents apiece at the grocery store
19015:14	because , you know , I 've talked to many people E_S
19019:44	If they make it so that it 's not a horrendous inconvenience , I think 0 most people would *?* . E_S
19022:20	oh , yeah . You know , E_S
19023:25	and I do n't mind , you know , E_S
19024:64	at first it was \[ the , \+ the \] little extra money that you got *T*-1 , you know , *-2 returning the cans in and stuff like that . E_S
19028:17	But now , you know , I do n't mind as long as things are getting recycled *-2 , you know , that we do n't get reimbursed *-1 . E_S
19028:65	But now , you know , I do n't mind as long as things are getting recycled *-2 , you know , that we do n't get reimbursed *-1 . E_S
19031:8	I think 0 \[ it 's , \+ it *EXP*-2 's , \] to me more of a convenience *ICH*-4 * to have them come *-3 pick it up , then * to get that two cents when you take it to the store *T*-1 . E_S
19036:33	Oh , \[ I , \+ oh , I \] know it . E_S
19052:8	I know \[ of one that , \+ 0 the one that \] we use *T*-1 , uh , has , uh , recycling for the bags . E_S
19056:50	\[ And , \+ uh , and \] they 're promoting the cloth bags . You know , the \[ reus- , \+ reusable \] cloth bags . E_S
19093:60	my husband about once a weekend he 'll go , uh , to a couple of areas where he knows that the people just throw cans out *T*-1 . E_S
19103:30	And , uh , it 's so , you know , N_S
19122:52	so they did say that you had *-1 to put it out within , I think 0 it was , uh , *RNR*-2 three weeks after , Christmas . E_S
19133:14	So , you know , if we have branches or something , they have *-1 to be cut *-2 in four-foot lengths , E_S
19179:10	and I think 0 that would be great if they could get something organized * along those lines . E_S
19188:28	Uh , because otherwise , uh , you know , they 're not going *-1 to go house-to-house *-2 collecting it , E_S
19195:16	Oh , I was thinking about , you know , like \[ the , \+ uh , the \] Styrofoam used * at , uh , the fast-food restaurants , that if everybody , uh , N_S
19195:29	Oh , I was thinking about , you know , like \[ the , \+ uh , the \] Styrofoam used * at , uh , the fast-food restaurants , that if everybody , uh , N_S
19201:8	I know like 0 our cafeteria here uses a lot of Styrofoam E_S

19244:13	I do n't know that it 's so much *ICH*-1 a military threat anymore as a , N_S

19676:21	I 'm trying *-1 to think back now , E_S

19737:71	It was made *-2 * to placate some of the northern support but not completely alienate all the southern support because , you know , \[ it was , \+ uh , if you read it , it only emancipated \] those who *T*-1 were in areas , uh , in rebellion against the United States . E_S

19773:8	They might as well have not even been there . E_S

19781:8	I thought , okay . E_S
19783:26	They supplied some , uh , you know , N_S
19791:13	I ca n't think of the guy 's name E_S

19802:45	And then the last Civil War battle was fought *-1 at Val Verde , you know , E_S
19835:14	so , you know , I was , N_S
19839:40	See I was raised *-1 in the Midwest which , you know ,

19965:13	I do n't know . E_S
19966:68	See , I had never really been into science fiction that much until , uh , somebody gave me MIST OF AVALON probably about five or six years ago . E_S
19970:13	I do n't know if I 'd call it science fiction or fantasy . E_S
19975:44	they just happen *-1 to put them in a futuristic setting , you know , E_S
19983:37	and , uh , I was reading DUNE . Which *T*-1 seeming rather ironic . E_S
19992:53	And I read the whole damn book while I was home *-1 hauling out , you know , like ten-gallon buckets \[ of , \+ of \] water and waiting for the roof to collapse and , reading about these guys wearing their little free man still suits E_S

20287:8	I think 0 it 's seven here . E_S

20344:13	I do n't know . E_S

20358:17	But , I do n't know , E_S
20360:11	I can think of all the biblical things about it , too . E_S
20362:13	I ca n't think of the scripture . E_S
20367:15	So , you know , \[ even , \+ even \] in the story where they had *-1 to pay the taxes *T*-2 , the disciples , and , uh , Jesus said the money in the fish 's mouth or in the fisher , inside the fish . E_S
20371:17	And , uh , I thought of those two things when \[ I was , \+ I was \] holding for a long time *T*-1 . E_S
20380:15	Well , you know , um , back then what they tried *-2 to do *T*-1 , you know , N_S

20407:10	you know , I do n't want *-1 to pay more than I have *-2 to *?* , E_S
20412:10	but I believe that they 're necessary . E_S
20438:47	Did you notice that when they passed the new simplified tax act *T*-1 , it seemed like it made everything harder ? E_S
20466:8	it seems like you make those payments every month E_S
20477:8	I know 0 I get paid *-1 twice a month , every two weeks , E_S
20503:8	They thought 0 their payment was automatically taken *-1 out like every other Wednesday , E_S
20535:100	And when we bought this house *T*-2 , we looked at * doing a fifteen year note , because it added more *ICH*-1 to the payment , but not significant amounts , you know , E_S
20542:39	That 's what we 're looking at *T*-1 , fifteen or maybe twenty . E_S
20579:13	I do n't know , E_S
20580:13	we could n't think of a better time 0 * to buy than now *T*-1 . E_S

20620:13	I did n't know any Walkers . E_S
20701:14	What did you think *T*-1 of Sam ? E_S
20712:43	He was very good for Lubbock when he came to , you know , N_S
20744:13	well , I know 0 they will *?* , E_S
20758:33	Well , since you live close , I do n't know if you know , um , about what Louisville is doing *T*-1 with recycling , E_S
20758:43	Well , since you live close , I do n't know if you know , um , about what Louisville is doing *T*-1 with recycling , E_S
20761:13	Well , I know that we have some relatives that *T*-1 live around , like the MUMBLEx area in there , E_S
20765:8	I know 0 they 're doing some curbside recycling as a kind of a test there . E_S
20768:10	You know , I read , you know , N_S
20768:28	You know , I read , you know , N_S
20770:14	And , you know , we separate everything out , and then have *-2 to haul it up to a Metco , you know , which *T*-1 is a real pain . E_S
20770:74	And , you know , we separate everything out , and then have *-2 to haul it up to a Metco , you know , which *T*-1 is a real pain . E_S
20787:27	Because I finally asked because , you know , we had all of those milk cartons E_S
20794:27	That 's really nice 0 * to know *T*-1 , because we were doing the same thing . E_S
20795:74	Because *-1 to take it to a Metco , you have *-1 to take it when they 're open *T*-3 , you know , which *T*-2 is always a real pain . E_S
20799:44	And so when that thing came up in Wal-Mart parking lot *T*-1 , we thought , oh , this is great . E_S
20801:34	And then , all the sudden , it disappeared , you know . E_S
20802:13	I did n't know . E_S
20809:16	I could n't even think of what you call them *T*-1 . E_S
20823:71	Is there \[ anything , \+ any place \] else that *T*-1 really takes anything other than that , that you know of *T*-2 ? E_S
20829:82	Uh , \[ I do n't , \+ we just do n't \] have the room 0 * to store all that much *T*-1 , you know , E_S
20831:8	I know . E_S
20835:8	I know . E_S
20836:8	I know . E_S
20840:10	You know , at first , you know , you , N_S
20840:28	You know , at first , you know , you , N_S
20843:48	but you kind of get , I guess , into a little routine , you know , where it *EXP*-2 \[ becomes , \+ is \] automatic , now , * to throw , different things in different places *T*-1 , E_S
20847:10	you know . So I just go , you know , N_S
20847:33	you know . So I just go , you know , N_S
20849:45	and I 've just got three trash cans sitting in there , E_S you know ,
20850:50	we just kind of dump things in each one , \[ if , \+ you know , if \] we get them , E_S
20862:48	I mean , you ca n't get the down to any size , you know . E_S
20863:46	If you get four milk cartons and that fills up trash bag , you know pretty easily , E_S
20864:14	so . You know , N_S
20879:17	and so , you know , when I found out some places 0 * to take it *T*-1 *T*-2 , N_S
20881:10	and I know that they 're going *-1 to use , you know , the money for that *-2 to build some kind of multipurpose field and that type of thing . Put lights and stuff E_S

20885:14	so , you know , if I 'm not going *-1 to get the money for aluminum , I would just assume give it *ICH*-3 to the city of Flower Mound . 0 * to do something with *T*-2 , you know . E_S

20903:36	Well , I was kind of hoping with , N_S you know ,
20916:14	And , you know , we 're recycling aluminum cans *ICH*-3 up here \[ and , \+ \] uh , just what you would buy *T*-1 out of the machines and drink *-2 here E_S
20917:39	and there was crushers out in all of the hallways you know , E_S
20920:20	It 's , N_S you know ,
20923:89	And they had talked about * having a thing like , one Saturday a month , you could come and drop your aluminum cans off from home , you know , E_S
20929:60	they would do that because at least somebody *ICH*-3 was getting the money out of it , you know . That *T*-1 was going *-2 to use it for good , E_S
20946:8	I know 0 they 've started over in Richardson where my dad lives *T*-1 . E_S
20947:23	They pick up newspapers , I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
21040:37	\[ And then , \+ uh , but \] I do n't know , E_S
21041:8	it seems like nowadays everything is so electronic , you know , magnified and animated , that you can grab from the old style movies and old style shows a little bit more insight to family groupings . E_S
21041:38	it seems like nowadays everything is so electronic , you know , magnified and animated , that you can grab from the old style movies and old style shows a little bit more insight to family groupings . E_S
21068:12	But , I think 0 there 's enough out there 0 * to pick from *T*-1 . E_S
21081:14	and , you know , I do n't want them watching something that I do n't think 0 they should watch *T*-1 E_S
21081:54	and , you know , I do n't want them watching something that I do n't think 0 they should watch *T*-1 E_S
21093:36	and then \[ I had , \+ well , you know , I 'd \] eat N_S
21095:45	And then , um , as my kids got older and started , you know , *-2 recognizing what *T*-1 was going on , I thought , this is n't really very good . E_S

21112:36	Uh , now \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know who the characters are *T*-1 , E_S
21121:8	this might \[ age me , \+ date me \] here ,
21128:21	Well , see , you 're probably about the same age as me because my mom watched the SECRET STORM , and the EDGE OF NIGHT . E_S
21133:13	Well , I think 0 they were back to back , and black and white . E_S
21146:31	And \[ AS THE WORLD TURNS . \+ I think 0 AS THE WORLD TURNS \] may , still on or not . N_S
21146:53	And \[ AS THE WORLD TURNS . \+ I think 0 AS THE WORLD TURNS \] may , still on or not . N_S
21159:8	I think 0 some of the tones of \[ the , \+ the \] daily prime time is questionable , E_S
21168:10	You know * keep them on the \[ channel eleven , \+ channel twenty one . \] The nature stuff , you know . E_S
21168:67	You know * keep them on the \[ channel eleven , \+ channel twenty one . \] The nature stuff , you know . E_S
21181:31	She 's more into WALT DISNEY kind , you know , E_S
21201:13	I do n't think so . E_S
21236:32	and they kind of are in different spectrums , I think 0 *T*-1 . Um , E_S
21242:15	And \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 they 're real different
21242:26	And \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 they 're real different
21243:27	, I mean , E_S I do n't think 0 they have anything in common , E_S
21252:31	and then NIGHT COURT is just pure , you know , weird fun , you know , E_S
21252:47	and then NIGHT COURT is just pure , you know , weird fun , you know , E_S
21254:17	So , I do n't know why the two of them happen , *-1 to be my two favorite shows *T*-2 , E_S
21269:23	and the only reason 0 I think 0 I like it now *T*-1 is because I 've seen it so much E_S
21271:22	but , I used *-1 to think , um , 0 Dan Fielding was just \[ too , \+ too \] vulgar and too crude for me . E_S
21293:55	and , uh , it 's taking up so much of his time and so much of his thought , that he really has , N_S
21294:61	in fact , there was one show that he even turned down a date with some , you know , beautiful woman *T*-1 just because the idea that \[ he was , \+ his mind \] was on the ozone layer and , you know , global warming and all this other kind of stuff . E_S

21302:8	I think 0 it \[ adds a , \+ probably adds a \] little bit of depth to his character . E_S

21308:8	I think so , E_S
21321:10	and I think 0 that 's , N_S
21326:13	Um , I think 0 my favorite show is HUNTER . E_S
21349:10	and I think 0 that 's what they try *-2 to do *T*-1 , E_S
21350:10	but I think 0 we wanted *-1 to see Dede *ICH*-2 there or somebody like her . E_S
21355:103	Well , but , see I read an article \[ about , \+ in T V GUIDE \[ about , \+ uh , about \] \] HUNTER , and about \[ his , you know , latest , \+ you know , his \] three girls , whatever you want *-1 to call them *T*-2 E_S

21372:10	you know , if you think about it , they did n't really interact hardly at all E_S
21372:22	you know , if you think about it , they did n't really interact hardly at all E_S
21384:10	and I think 0 that 's what I did n't like *T*-1 . E_S
21387:17	but , uh , it seemed like it was almost two different organizations you know , E_S

21414:13	I do n't know , E_S

21446:143	But \[ it 's , \+ it *EXP*-3 's \] always been a formula , uh , for T V \[ that the minute that two people , \+ that the two main stars \] get married *-1 *T*-4 , that the show ends up , you know , *-2 dying . E_S
21451:17	and , \+ you know , this \] is probabl- , N_S
21452:5	maybe it 's not a good example . E_S
21479:8	it seems like you can do so much more of the subtle hints and the subtle little plays on things \[ \[ before they , \+ they , \] \+ before they \] get married *-1 you know , E_S
21479:117	it seems like you can do so much more of the subtle hints and the subtle little plays on things \[ \[ before they , \+ they , \] \+ before they \] get married *-1 you know , E_S
21484:45	\[ and \+ and , \] well , of course , another one of their mistakes , I think 0 *T*-3 , is 0 they have a tendency *-2 to change characters , or to change the characters ' , uh , uh , personalities well , especially after they get married *-1 . E_S
21484:55	\[ and \+ and , \] well , of course , another one of their mistakes , I think 0 *T*-3 , is 0 they have a tendency *-2 to change characters , or to change the characters ' , uh , uh , personalities well , especially after they get married *-1 . E_S
21503:10	You know , why would they do that *T*-1 ? E_S
21511:16	Unfortunately , that 's probably true . E_S
21519:47	\[ That 's , \+ uh , that 's \] on Tuesday nights I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
21535:10	and I think 0 they 're thinking about that exact thing , about the idea that if the show lets them , uh , get together , then you lose part of what the show 's all about *T*-1 . E_S
21535:23	and I think 0 they 're thinking about that exact thing , about the idea that if the show lets them , uh , get together , then you lose part of what the show 's all about *T*-1 . E_S
21539:15	So . I always thought 0 that was kind of weird . E_S
21546:36	like , for instance , where as the teenager , you know , you \[ romance a , \+ romanticize a \] rock star , E_S
21551:10	and I think 0 it 's the same with your characters on T V . E_S
21553:10	Do you think 0 that 's why most rock stars nowadays keep their marriages secret *T*-1 , or at least they keep it quiet *T*-1 . E_S
21560:8	I know 0 it affected me when I was younger *T*-1 . E_S
21581:15	So I do n't know , E_S
21586:11	I would think so . E_S
21606:8	I think 0 we 've covered our time . E_S
21619:13	Well , I think 0 I 've , um , N_S
21689:31	and my eleven year old , of course , you know , is pitching . E_S
21700:10	and it seems like soon as that over with we get into basketball . E_S
21735:40	well , first , they always say , * get *-1 to know your country first before you leave , E_S
21743:10	You know , I 've heard , 0 we have a couple of friends that *T*-1 goes to Washington quite often , E_S
21746:26	They went to the Memorial , you know , E_S
21775:30	So , but um , now , I do n't know , E_S
21800:34	uh , a very , uh , family thing , you know , made * , like * go *-1 skiing in Vermont or something . E_S
21810:10	You know , one of those hell family vacations . E_S
21813:28	but \[ we try , \+ you know , I try , \] N_S
21818:30	because , uh , my dad died , you know , when I was less than a year old *T*-1 E_S
21823:13	So I always thought , 0 when I have kids *T*-2 , you know , I really want *-1 to be involved *-1 with them . E_S
21823:46	So I always thought , 0 when I have kids *T*-2 , you know , I really want *-1 to be involved *-1 with them . E_S
21833:34	\[ And , \+ and \] to me , you know , it 's like , now I 'm twenty-two , E_S
21834:23	but I still feel , you know , N_S
21841:41	\[ \[ he , \+ like he , \] \+ you know , like he \] wants *-1 to be best friends now E_S
21846:14	because , you know , it 's like you grow up *-1 to be twenty years old , E_S
21856:19	but , uh , you know , it 's like , I can only express myself so much , E_S
21857:14	because , you know , um , everything \[ that he taught me *T*-3 , \+ you know , that my family taught me *T*-1 , \] which is very hard *-2 to change that all of a sudden from one year to the next and say , I 'm sorry , you know . E_S
21857:61	because , you know , um , everything \[ that he taught me *T*-3 , \+ you know , that my family taught me *T*-1 , \] which is very hard *-2 to change that all of a sudden from one year to the next and say , I 'm sorry , you know . E_S

21858:21	It 's like , you know , I love you E_S
21859:67	and * let 's go out and do things together when I do n't feel like it *T*-1 , you know E_S
21864:38	I 've seen 0 my uncle and his family , you know , does everything together , E_S
21865:12	and you know , his kids are , you know , N_S
21865:32	and you know , his kids are , you know , N_S
21867:46	and she could go *-1 to sleep at two in the morning you know E_S
21876:72	just so long as you can get up *-1 to go to class the next morning , you can stay up you know , E_S
21891:36	we have *-1 to take them , and , you know * to do it . E_S
21896:47	because you 're saying , Well , I work full time too , you know . E_S
21900:60	but , uh , \[ it 's just , \+ it 's just \] something that , you know , N_S
21901:20	my theory is , you know , 0 \[ when , \+ when \] you have kids and all *T*-1 \[ you , \+ you \] want *-2 to do , well , N_S
21902:32	what I 'll do *T*-1 is , you know , like , N_S
21903:18	I mean , you might have problems , E_S
21904:30	but it 's not your kids ' problems you know , E_S
21909:73	and you got *-1 to try *-2 to be with them as much as you can *?* E_S and to , you know , like , N_S
21910:38	thing \[ is , \+ is , \] that , you know , like \[ if , \+ if \] they would ever happen *-1 to have a drug problem , * suppose , that they could feel comfortable *-2 coming to me and saying , I got a problem you know , E_S
21910:159	thing \[ is , \+ is , \] that , you know , like \[ if , \+ if \] they would ever happen *-1 to have a drug problem , * suppose , that they could feel comfortable *-2 coming to me and saying , I got a problem you know , E_S
21915:66	\[ and , \+ uh and \] that would make any parent feel good and bad at the same time , you know , E_S
21920:58	and * let 's see how we can get rid *-1 of the problem *T*-2 , you know , E_S
21922:42	because once you 're best friends with your parents , then , I think 0 everything go a lot better . E_S
21936:25	so it was , uh , you know , N_S
21938:23	and it 's pretty hard you know , E_S
21959:14	But , you know , like , \[ \[ four , \+ I mean fou- , \] \+ four \] children is expensive , \[ especially when you consider \+ like , especially for me , \] which I 'm paying out of state tuition . E_S
21960:21	I 'm paying , you know , three thousand , E_S
21966:14	And , you know , people say , you know , 0 it *EXP*-1 's expensive * to think 0 it 's college , E_S
21966:32	And , you know , people say , you know , 0 it *EXP*-1 's expensive * to think 0 it 's college , E_S
21966:61	And , you know , people say , you know , 0 it *EXP*-1 's expensive * to think 0 it 's college , E_S
21967:53	but , \[ if , \+ if \] everybody would be a little bit responsible , you know , E_S
21972:24	and they live at home you know , E_S
21977:12	but you know , seven hundred dollars a semester , E_S
21978:46	a lot of people can spare that if they planned ahead , you know , like N_S
21984:53	I mean , it 's like , if you plan a year ahead , you can probably save up seven hundred dollars you know , one thousand four hundred dollars * to send your child to college , you know . E_S
21984:76	I mean , it 's like , if you plan a year ahead , you can probably save up seven hundred dollars you know , one thousand four hundred dollars * to send your child to college , you know . E_S
21984:121	I mean , it 's like , if you plan a year ahead , you can probably save up seven hundred dollars you know , one thousand four hundred dollars * to send your child to college , you know . E_S
22028:39	\[ So , \+ uh , and , \] uh , I was thinking , you know , like , Oh my God , you know , I go back there , E_S
22028:49	\[ So , \+ uh , and , \] uh , I was thinking , you know , like , Oh my God , you know , I go back there , E_S
22028:75	\[ So , \+ uh , and , \] uh , I was thinking , you know , like , Oh my God , you know , I go back there , E_S
22031:34	and then I 'll never leave the place , you know . E_S
22036:8	I know , E_S
22039:57	and then when he went down there *T*-1 , E_S he was just so bad off , you know from *-2 not being able *-3 to stay up here that his life just went down the drain . E_S
22048:8	Well maybe something will open up for you . E_S
22060:10	Well , may- , N_S
22073:52	and , what you see *T*-1 on the T V -s \[ from , \+ you know , in \] Washington and New York . N_S
22074:15	So what I believe 0 the people want *T*-1 , N_S
22076:20	but I have , you know , concerns , E_S
22081:44	I mean , \[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] think , 0 ideally , you know , you need money *-1 to do everything E_S
22081:63	I mean , \[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] think , 0 ideally , you know , you need money *-1 to do everything E_S
22110:46	so a lot of the , uh , cars go to , uh , you know , MUMBLEx shops , E_S
22124:166	and once you 've reached \[ the , \+ the \] river walk area , which *T*-1 is the tourist area , it 's usually pretty safe during the day , if you 're just kind of cautious and do n't go down the back streets or alleys , \[ and , \+ \] um , you know , or alone . E_S
22152:32	Well , it 's a big tourist town , you know , E_S
22159:90	but at night , they even have the policemen come around at dusk and sound their sirens , * pretty much telling people , * be wary , you know , and get off the beach . E_S
22161:26	It 's just so sad , you know , E_S
22162:29	it is just really so sad , you know , E_S
22164:26	Um , in San Antonio I do n't know what the answer is *T*-1 . E_S
22165:15	Education , I think 0 *T*-1 , is a lot of it . E_S
22169:8	I think 0 education helps a little bit there . E_S
22170:25	Um , then again , I do n't know really what steps *ICH*-2 there are *T*-1 that they , N_S
22194:10	And it seems that * the younger 0 you can get them and get them involved *-1 with programs after school *-3 *T*-2 , you might keep them E_S
22194:84	And it seems that * the younger 0 you can get them and get them involved *-1 with programs after school *-3 *T*-2 , you might keep them E_S
22200:90	but \[ you , \+ again , you \] need that one on one like a big brother , trying *-1 to \[ keep the younger kid , \+ you know , tell him , \] hey * stay in school , E_S
22201:24	it 'll get better , you know , E_S
22207:13	you do n't know , E_S
22209:49	You do n't have *-1 to live \[ on the , \+ \] you know , for a street life . E_S
22226:8	They might have five hundred troubled youths . E_S
22261:13	I do n't know how you combat that *T*-1 . E_S
22262:28	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't know where you start \[ or , \+ \] with a lot of these kids *T*-1 , E_S
22267:61	and unless you can take them out of the environment enough to where they do n't have the peer pressure from the gangs as soon as they come home from school *T*-1 . E_S
22269:13	Well , I think 0 a lot of it is 0 the parents are totally irresponsible , too . E_S
22274:10	The parents might be thirty years old E_S
22280:43	but I have the morals that *T*-1 keep me from , you know , N_S
22282:17	These people , you know , they bring \[ their , \+ their \] Johns home E_S
22294:15	And I do n't know how you combat that *T*-1 . E_S
22296:13	I do n't know what the answer *ICH*-2 is *T*-1 to that problem , you know . E_S
22296:51	I do n't know what the answer *ICH*-2 is *T*-1 to that problem , you know . E_S
22314:13	I do n't know how * to make it better for them *T*-1 E_S
22315:14	or , you know , because \[ it , \+ \]
22319:45	and \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] going off , you know , E_S
22329:10	the parents might have hostilities towards them , you know , Like you 're judging us , E_S
22329:33	the parents might have hostilities towards them , you know , Like you 're judging us , E_S
22332:8	I think so , E_S
22349:10	and I might see it on \[ a , \+ you know , a \] SIXTY MINUTES special . E_S
22349:39	and I might see it on \[ a , \+ you know , a \] SIXTY MINUTES special . E_S
22356:8	I know it E_S
22357:38	but San Antonio is considered *-1 a nice clean city , * believe it or not . E_S
22372:20	they 're very bold it seems 0 *T*-1 . E_S
22379:10	most everybody seems pretty well employed around here , E_S
22384:19	and uh , they all seem *-1 to congregate in Celinas , not so much here in Monterrey . E_S
22385:46	So , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] pretty quiet . You know , E_S
22388:12	and you know , you 're just , N_S
22396:41	\[ I , \+ if I \] did it every night I think 0 there would be trouble in our house , E_S
22404:15	but I do n't think 0 you would *?* , uh , E_S
22405:8	someone might grab you , mess around with you , E_S
22417:13	I did n't know that about Burlington , E_S
22432:15	and I did n't know anybody who *T*-1 had a boat now , E_S
22468:8	I know , 0 I , N_S
22473:68	so , \[ it 's , \+ they do \] a lot of shark fishing \[ in that , \+ you know , in the \] gulf E_S
22477:23	and , um , there 's a certain period of time during the year 0 \[ they have \+ all along the gulf coast \[ from , \+ I guess from \] Galveston to Mayport they have , \] uh , shark tournaments *T*-1 , E_S
22478:14	and , you know , there 's part , N_S either as part of *RNR*-1 or separate from *RNR*-1 the , uh , bill fishing tournaments 0 they usually have *T*-2
22479:58	so , I have not done , uh , much \[ freshwater fishing oh , for , \+ you know , \[ lake , \+ lake \] fishing for \] bass and so forth but , uh , maybe some what they call *T*-1 brim and those sorts of things , but nothing , N_S

22492:8	I think 0 I 've been *-1 trout fishing once . E_S
22498:13	I do n't know that I could do that . E_S
22548:10	you know , there are people who *T*-1 fish , E_S
22563:41	Oh , and occasionally we 'd go out on a , you know , full day trip , you know , three or four other people and do either , again , bottom fishing \[ or \+ or \] for grouper E_S

22570:38	or , \[ I used * to catch \+ you know , I 've caught \] a few worthwhile snappers , red snappers and gray snappers and so forth . E_S
22587:47	Um , but , um , I went *-1 fishing at , I do n't know if you 've ever heard of *RNR*-2 , uh , Lake Worth . E_S
22626:14	or , you know , actually we were , uh , snapper fishing . E_S
22637:58	and , uh , \[ the , \+ uh , the \] party boat captain could not understand , you know , E_S
22645:10	just hoping maybe , 0 he could pull . N_S
22659:28	And they do , of course , you know , N_S
22661:66	\[ we 're \[ only just a few , \+ not a few minutes , \] \+ we 're , you know , forty five minutes to an hour \] away from the eastern shore here in Maryland E_S
22682:88	The weirdest fishing experience 0 I ever had *T*-1 . People to this day are still trying *-2 to figure out if I really caught what I think 0 I caught *T*-3 . E_S

22702:11	I 'm sure 0 it 's not a fish , E_S

22738:13	I do n't know if you 've ever heard of it E_S
22751:50	\[ and \+ I mean , and \] they come in all si- , you know , N_S
22752:47	\[ I 've , \+ I 've \] caught them from , you know , three or four inches long up to , uh , N_S
22756:43	I guess 0 the largest one 0 I ever caught *T*-1 was probably eight or ten inches long , E_S
22768:28	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't think 0 I 'd want *-1 to *?* even if you could *?* if they 're that ugly , E_S
22782:53	and the first thing 0 I caught *T*-1 was a sand shark , which *T*-2 was probably a foot , and a half or , uh , two feet long , E_S
22792:10	and I thought , oh , \[ really , \+ here , I 'm really \] going *-1 to get one . E_S
22803:29	so I 've always been involved , you know , in one . E_S
22807:58	Well , \[ I 've \+ Well , I can \] kind of see both sides , you know , E_S
22812:29	I would personally be the last resort you know , \[ I rea- , \+ \] you know if I had *-1 to put someone in there . E_S

22831:90	but , um , I guess , um , 0 the one time that I saw him there *T*-1 , you know , as far as the surroundings , that seemed okay . E_S
22835:22	But , um , we kind of thought that maybe they just wanted *-1 to give him some medication * to sort of , you know keep him real out of it all the time E_S

22845:18	Well , I kind of think 0 that 's true , too . I guess , because it 's so under staffed , you know E_S
22845:75	Well , I kind of think 0 that 's true , too . I guess , because it 's so under staffed , you know E_S
22856:10	and I know that she 's the kind of person who *T*-1 would n't allow , you know , a lot of the horror things *ICH*-3 to take place that you hear about *T*-2 . E_S

22969:21	There 's also , you know , some private ones , you know E_S
22969:40	There 's also , you know , some private ones , you know E_S

22996:85	but \[ \[ I , \+ there 's , \] I think 0 there 's \] ways around it *ICH*-1 , though , that , you know , N_S
22997:53	like , they could put it in one of their children 's names or something you know . E_S
23002:10	You know , it 's their money . E_S
23006:10	You know , that 's how I feel about it *T*-1 , anyway . E_S
23014:14	But , you know , what if . E_S
23025:8	I think 0 that 's wonderful , E_S
23028:73	and then on the other hand , I 've seen 0 some people go into the nursing home and * just so happy you know . E_S
23039:38	Some of those places have wonderful activities and things , you know , lots of stuff going on . E_S
23048:18	so . I do n't know , E_S
23053:42	but I guess 0 once you get ill , then , you know , you really have some problems if you ca n't get around and do things . E_S
23059:18	But I really do n't know what the other solution would be *T*-1 you know , E_S
23059:47	But I really do n't know what the other solution would be *T*-1 you know , E_S
23070:36	because I have been raised *-1 in one , you know , E_S
23071:32	so there 's lot of things 0 I know *-1 to look for *T*-3 . E_S
23075:15	And I do n't think 0 they 'd want *-1 to go where they used *-2 to work *T*-3 , either you know . E_S
23075:75	And I do n't think 0 they 'd want *-1 to go where they used *-2 to work *T*-3 , either you know . E_S
23081:8	That might be kind of tough , huh . E_S
23087:18	and I really do n't think 0 my mother 'd want *-1 to be there , either . E_S
23104:17	So what do you think *T*-1 about it ? E_S
23108:13	Well , I think 0 we need *-1 to do more . E_S
23109:18	I mean , I know 0 I need *-1 to do more . E_S
23115:70	But I have a hard time \[ of * being able , \+ \] of * \[ separating , \+ you know , \[ having a place , \+ \] separating \] my trash , E_S and get all the cans from the paper , N_S
23119:14	and , you know , I just have n't gotten that dedicated yet . E_S
23131:10	You know , I do n't recycle my newspapers myself , E_S
23132:105	but I noticed in one of the sales catalogs this weekend 0 they have \[ \[ a , \+ like a , \] \+ a \] clothes hamper kind of thing that , you know , you lay your string in *T*-1 , then you put your papers in there tie them all up and bundle them up , E_S
23136:20	so I figured 0 I might get me one of those because we do n't always read the newspaper . E_S
23145:14	but , you know , I get it on , N_S
23146:28	I try *-1 to buy , you know , the early edition *ICH*-2 for the coupons , you know , the Sunday edition . E_S
23146:59	I try *-1 to buy , you know , the early edition *ICH*-2 for the coupons , you know , the Sunday edition . E_S
23151:25	But , then I just , you know , bundle it up and put it on \[ the front , \+ you know , the front \] walk \[ ev- , \+ you know , every \] Monday or every other Monday , and have them pick that up , E_S

23169:40	I 'm not exactly sure where \[ the , \+ you know , the \] can thing is *T*-1 , E_S
23170:14	but , you know , sometimes it 's just so , N_S
23171:8	* seems so much easier *ICH*-3 *-1 just to take it and throw it in the trash , and have them pick it up than it *EXP*-4 is *?* * to smash the cans and drive it some place * to have them . E_S
23199:18	because those things I think 0 *T*-1 would just snap you know . E_S
23199:41	because those things I think 0 *T*-1 would just snap you know . E_S
23206:15	and I do n't know what affiliate of Payless Cashways you have *T*-1 up there , E_S
23211:93	I 'd have *-1 to check into something like that , because , I mean , we do n't drink a whole lot of soda around here , you know , E_S
23212:17	but , um you know , occasionally we have some around , E_S

23316:13	I do n't know what New York does *T*-1 about theirs . E_S

23323:24	\[ so . \+ But \] I think 0 we 're getting better at it E_S
23327:8	I think 0 there 's quite a bit more 0 we could do *T*-1 . E_S

23398:10	You know , the more trash 0 you have *T*-1 laying around the more bugs you get *T*-2 , E_S
23399:14	that 's for sure . E_S
23411:10	You know , * pick it up . E_S
23460:23	\[ I , \+ I \] believe in the trial by jury . E_S

23462:68	And I also like the unanimous decision because you have *-1 to persuade everybody *-2 to be a hundred percent , absolutely sure before you convict somebody . E_S
23464:8	I think 0 \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] a good way 0 * to do it *T*-1 . E_S
23467:18	Well , \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 basically we 're in a lot of agreement , uh , in that I certainly agree that for any case involving serious injury to another person then maybe that needs , uh , some kind of legal definition . E_S
23467:29	Well , \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 basically we 're in a lot of agreement , uh , in that I certainly agree that for any case involving serious injury to another person then maybe that needs , uh , some kind of legal definition . E_S

23471:32	But for anything involving that , trial by jury certainly should be mandatory . E_S
23476:8	it seems to me like there ought *-2 to be a means \[ of , \+ of , \] um , * not having *-1 to take everything before a full court . You know , E_S
23476:107	it seems to me like there ought *-2 to be a means \[ of , \+ of , \] um , * not having *-1 to take everything before a full court . You know , E_S
23477:5	maybe there ought *-1 to be some kind \[ of , \+ of , \] uh , MUMBLEx N_S

23504:11	I just think 0 our system is overworked , E_S

23509:69	Maybe this pre group of people could decide , you know , \[ which kind of , \+ uh , you know , where they could go *T*-1 \] from there . E_S
23511:35	or do they need a six person jury or , you know , those kinds of things E_S
23512:47	and the degree \[ of the , \+ of \[ the , \+ you know , the \] \] seriousness of it , you know , E_S
23512:77	and the degree \[ of the , \+ of \[ the , \+ you know , the \] \] seriousness of it , you know , E_S
23514:24	is this open and shut , you know , like you were saying , E_S
23515:76	or do you need somebody to go off for three months and try *-1 to figure out what *T*-3 really happened . You know , a jury like that . E_S
23517:10	You know , we , N_S
23522:10	You know , kind of MUMBLEx off what we 've been talking about *T*-1 here , uh , I believe that \[ our , \+ \] we 've become almost a litigious society where \[ we , \+ everyone \] is very quick *-2 to sue or to threaten *-2 to sue and that kind of stuff *T*-3 , E_S

23523:43	and although we supporting a whole segment of society called * lawyers , maybe we do n't need *-1 to do that . E_S
23530:10	You know , maybe , instead of * being so quick *-1 to sue you , uh , if you have a disagreement with someone , instead of * tying up court and time and that kind of stuff , \[ maybe you \+ \[ nee- , \+ \] maybe you , \] N_S
23530:15	You know , maybe , instead of * being so quick *-1 to sue you , uh , if you have a disagreement with someone , instead of * tying up court and time and that kind of stuff , \[ maybe you \+ \[ nee- , \+ \] maybe you , \] N_S

23561:19	But , uh , you know , that whole Biblical concept like \[ that , \+ that 's \] true in a lot of our , N_S

23565:43	\[ And , \+ uh , so \] \[ that , \+ you know , that \] could work , E_S

23732:36	Do you buy them , um , separately at , you know , an American grocery store now , E_S
23737:72	but what *T*-1 happens is 0 in Argentina they have like all these little places like the fruit stand , and , you know , the dairy , and products and whatever , E_S

23779:47	And then what you have *T*-1 is also \[ like , \+ you know , like \] three different kinds of salad . E_S

23961:15	um , do you know what hoi sin sauce is *T*-1 , E_S
24004:85	For two people , um , \[ Amer- , \+ \] if it 's American style , I buy a half a pound . \[ If , you know , we , \+ if you 're \] just serving that , E_S
24005:82	but if you 're serving another dish with it , * say the rice dish um , well , with guys pretty healthy appetites , I 'd probably go a third of a pound E_S
24009:17	and then , you know , you could , N_S
24012:11	I could probably go half a pound . E_S
24014:65	And \[ you can always , \+ you can always \] heat it up again , and save , you know . E_S
24045:51	A can would serve you \[ \[ for , \+ for , \] \+ you know , for \] quite a few , um , meals , you know . E_S

24117:32	Well , \[ I kn- , \+ I \] know ,
24130:8	I know . E_S
24139:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think that I 've noticed that \] N_S
24141:8	I think 0 if you 're going into like , uh , law or medicine , a very particular , very specific field , \[ even , \+ even \] engineering , \[ you can get , \+ you can meet \] a lot of the requirements at a public , um , institution . E_S
24149:32	\[ My parents , \+ my parents \] made a mistake \[ in , \+ uh , in \] *-1 sending my sister to a private institution for the first two years . E_S

24164:20	Um , E_S I did n't know what I wanted *-1 to do *T*-2 after I got \[ my , \+ my \] degree . E_S

24221:81	\[ it 's , \+ it 's \] actually turning out *-1 to be \[ more , \+ more \] useful than what I thought *T*-2 . E_S

24281:50	\[ Probably , \+ you probably \] got everybody on you , because they were probably all going to law school . E_S
24285:48	she said \[ My , \+ my \] best friends are lawyers and you know , all this , E_S

25228:64	\[ it , \+ it 's \] kind of like * expecting everyone to suddenly speak German . You know . E_S

25245:8	I think 0 we kept it at real good . E_S
25255:8	I think 0 that was good . E_S
25261:8	You know what I mean *T*-1 . E_S
25283:18	Well , uh , I think 0 the weather lately has been a bit warmer than I would expect this time of year . E_S
25285:8	I think 0 that 's true . E_S
25287:24	\[ So . \+ So \] I think 0 we 're a little \[ hea- , \+ ahead \] of schedule on that . E_S

25303:122	Well , um , oh , I guess 0 another thing 0 I 've noticed *T*-1 , too , here lately is that even though we 've had some pretty warm days , it 's been awfully gray , you know , just , N_S
25309:10	But it seems like every time 0 at work I look out my window *T*-1 it 's gray . E_S
25326:8	I think 0 there 's an eighty percent chance this evening , E_S
25332:10	But I think 0 the highs are going *-1 to be in the sixties , and the lows in the forties . E_S
25336:8	that probably is a little bit under what it is *T*-1 for this time of year . E_S
25337:8	I think , E_S

25342:13	I 'm not certain either , E_S
25343:13	but you 're probably right . E_S
25347:51	Well , I like it when it 's sort of a medium temperature , uh , maybe seventy-five to eighty , somewhere in there *T*-1 . E_S
25360:11	You 're probably right . E_S
25366:10	and I think 0 it was one day this week a year ago E_S
25370:50	they said that we had a freeze and some kind of bad weather . You know E_S
25381:41	One of the weirdest things 0 I saw *T*-1 , I think 0 it was around this time last year was a twenty-six degree lightening storm . E_S
25385:22	\[ I , \+ you know , I \] was going into the grocery store , E_S

25398:28	\[ It , \+ uh , it \] probably was a lot warmer up high . E_S
25439:28	Uh , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 I am *?* . E_S
25475:36	I have a hard time *-1 inventing shots , you know . E_S
25476:36	* Let 's go around this tree , and you know , try a slice through a hook here , E_S

25606:13	and it just seems like every couple of years I get back in there . E_S

25668:10	You know , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] pretty nice and friendly out there E_S

25694:50	Uh , it runs from like five o'clock to seven thirty or eight o'clock , you know , because it does n't get dark until nine thirty or ten . E_S
25709:14	and , you know , we had a lot of girls out there a couple of years ago , E_S
25711:14	and , you know , they were shooting a hundred , hundred and twenty E_S

25720:33	so , it wo n't take her long . You know , E_S

25780:54	\[ I 've , \+ I 've \] kind of formed the attitude that , you know , \[ if I could just , \+ if I could \] pick two or three shots \[ out , \+ uh , out \] of my game every time and put them together on one hole , then I do pretty good E_S

26804:15	and I do n't know who *T*-1 's even proposing it , \[ or , \+ or \] how they plan on *-2 implementing it *T*-3 , if they do . E_S
26812:28	\[ I , \+ I 'm \] not sure either . E_S
26813:12	But , I think , 0 there would have *-1 to be a lot more , you know , information , you know , disseminated *-3 , before you say , *-2 let 's do this , you know . E_S
26813:57	But , I think , 0 there would have *-1 to be a lot more , you know , information , you know , disseminated *-3 , before you say , *-2 let 's do this , you know . E_S
26813:71	But , I think , 0 there would have *-1 to be a lot more , you know , information , you know , disseminated *-3 , before you say , *-2 let 's do this , you know . E_S
26813:120	But , I think , 0 there would have *-1 to be a lot more , you know , information , you know , disseminated *-3 , before you say , *-2 let 's do this , you know . E_S
26819:8	I think 0 * going to the schools would be the easiest for them . E_S
26823:10	You know , it be , N_S
26840:39	and \[ you , \+ you \] give them your speech and maybe a little slide show or something , E_S
26844:12	and , I think , that they could get some results from that , because there are a lot of people who *T*-1 are volunteer and community minded , E_S
26848:15	but they do n't know where * to go *T*-1 *-2 \[ \[ to , \+ to , \] \+ to \] do anything . E_S
26861:67	I do n't really see the emphasis on things like Peace Corps , like 0 \[ we , \+ you know , we \] saw *T*-1 back , I guess , in the Carter administration , E_S
26870:71	And , \[ I guess even back to Kennedy , \+ as a matter of fact , I guess 0 Kennedy \] may be the one that *T*-1 actually started the thing , or was , you know , really interested in things like that . E_S
26870:117	And , \[ I guess even back to Kennedy , \+ as a matter of fact , I guess 0 Kennedy \] may be the one that *T*-1 actually started the thing , or was , you know , really interested in things like that . E_S
26875:28	Like I say , I do n't even know what programs *T*-1 \[ are , \+ are \] even ongoing now , you know . E_S
26875:75	Like I say , I do n't even know what programs *T*-1 \[ are , \+ are \] even ongoing now , you know . E_S
26922:15	I , uh , thought 0 I wanted *-1 to be a teacher E_S
26940:8	I thought 0 I was going *-1 to be smart and get the good kids ,
26941:4	wrong . E_S
26968:8	I maybe should have taken the higher grades because at least you can , if you have *-1 to *?* you can get mean with them . E_S
26976:72	I started out *-1 wanting *-2 to teach \[ ele- , \+ \] lower , like primary and then top primary and thought , well , no , I do n't like this as much and ended up *-3 moving up and got up until about the sixth E_S
26992:15	but I do n't think 0 they could cover everything that you could teach , your children *T*-1 on an individual basis . E_S
27001:10	You know . And plus it also depends on the district 0 you 're in *T*-1 as , I mean , on the , N_S
27012:13	I do n't know . E_S
27021:84	Um , but \[ now , \+ nowadays \] \[ they ca n't even , \+ they can barely \] scold the children for something , you know , without * getting sued . E_S
27036:15	And I did n't believe it for a minute . E_S
27040:43	Um , \[ so , \+ uh , but , \] uh , you know , the , N_S
27052:8	I think 0 I understood \[ what the , \+ what the \] kid was doing *T*-1
27067:15	And you do n't know if you were reaching them or not E_S
27068:23	but we felt like , you know , * maybe just going ahead and \[ * try *-3 to teaching them was bet- , \+ trying *-2 to teach them was better \] than * have them taken *-1 out . E_S
27068:33	but we felt like , you know , * maybe just going ahead and \[ * try *-3 to teaching them was bet- , \+ trying *-2 to teach them was better \] than * have them taken *-1 out . E_S
27084:13	I do n't know if * was alcohol or something else that they were on *T*-1 E_S
27088:18	Uh , I do n't know , E_S
27090:19	and , N_S I do n't know E_S
27093:8	I think 0 there 's a problem *ICH*-1 too with teachers trying *-2 \[ to , \+ um , to \] be so versatile that they do loose sight of the basics , you know , E_S
27093:111	I think 0 there 's a problem *ICH*-1 too with teachers trying *-2 \[ to , \+ um , to \] be so versatile that they do loose sight of the basics , you know , E_S
27099:22	\[ just , \+ you know , * just \] teach the basics in schools E_S
27100:10	but I think 0 there does need *-1 to be a reemphasis of those because , of \[ our , \+ our \] lower grades in the standardized test and such . E_S
27105:10	Oh , sure . E_S
27106:98	I mean , \[ \[ i- , \+ i- , \] \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] indicative across the board that \[ we , \+ we 've \] done something wrong . E_S
27111:14	and , you know , here we are *T*-1 E_S
27116:18	Um , I do n't know . E_S
27126:42	And then at the end \[ of the , \+ of a \] certain time period you spitted everything back out E_S
27201:13	I do n't know . E_S
27225:8	I think 0 it 's like a lot of things \[ in the , \+ in the \] United States . E_S
27245:18	Well , I do n't know E_S
27253:10	And I think 0 part of it is that they 've got *-1 to give authority back to the local school . E_S
27257:10	You know , I mean , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] silly \[ that these , \+ that these \] people are handcuffed *-2 when it comes to discipline *T*-1 . E_S
27277:10	you know , they 're kind of fearful of , everything . E_S
27291:18	Well , \[ I think , \+ I think , \] 0 \[ I , \+ I \] mean what we 've turned the school schools into *T*-1 now are just day-care centers E_S
27291:29	Well , \[ I think , \+ I think , \] 0 \[ I , \+ I \] mean what we 've turned the school schools into *T*-1 now are just day-care centers E_S
27294:10	you know , somebody , N_S
27305:10	You know , they 're just , N_S
27310:10	Oh , sure . E_S
27320:17	So , I do n't know , E_S
27321:13	I do n't know , E_S
27322:13	I do n't know what the answer is *T*-1 . E_S
27332:17	They allow it under certain circumstances . E_S
27343:10	You know , \[ they , \+ they \] will allow you to , N_S
27344:13	I ca n't think of any examples E_S
27345:7	but certain religious groups do n't want their children in public schools because the influence . E_S
27346:7	And maybe they were a group of Mennonites or something like that . E_S
27350:13	I do n't think 0 they 're were in this area E_S
27364:22	I mean , it *EXP*-1 seems silly that , um , we started N_S
27450:29	because \[ we were , \+ you know , we were \] trying *-1 to make the house look nice *-2 to sell it E_S
27451:54	and we were painting it and trying *-1 to \[ do , \+ uh , you know , make \] it , N_S
27452:38	and \[ it , \+ it \] really was , you know , N_S
27454:26	the job was considerably tougher than we thought . E_S
27461:10	and it seemed like \[ there was , \+ it was \] a good sized den with a lot panelling E_S
27471:34	That was one of the requirements from , you know , F H A that the house be painted *-1 before we bought it E_S
27503:40	But my wife went to the , uh , Home Depot , I think 0 it was *?* , \[ and , \+ and \] took \[ a , \+ uh , a \] copy , took a piece of brick E_S
27527:10	you know , they , N_S
27547:77	That 's one of the problems though when you start *-3 painting *T*-2 * to try *-1 to get the , you know , N_S
27560:72	and the blue , even \[ so many years , \+ two years *ICH*-1 later or so \] it does n't match , you know , E_S
27592:31	because \[ it , \+ uh , it \] seems like everybody has \[ a , \+ \] you know , *-1 to go in and do , N_S
27592:64	because \[ it , \+ uh , it \] seems like everybody has \[ a , \+ \] you know , *-1 to go in and do , N_S
27603:8	We thought , uh , you know , N_S
27603:23	We thought , uh , you know , N_S
27605:35	but the other trim , N_S I 'm trying *-1 to think , E_S \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 we left most of it because it gets *-2 to be , uh , N_S
27605:50	but the other trim , N_S I 'm trying *-1 to think , E_S \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 we left most of it because it gets *-2 to be , uh , N_S

27626:33	Actually , \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know whether it made , N_S
27630:81	in our down stairs in our dining room we have a formal dining room , it has molding , uh , like picture frames , I do n't know what you \[ call that *T*-1 \+ that \] *T*-2 actually , that *T*-3 are along the walls , you know , up a couple of feet . E_S
27630:152	in our down stairs in our dining room we have a formal dining room , it has molding , uh , like picture frames , I do n't know what you \[ call that *T*-1 \+ that \] *T*-2 actually , that *T*-3 are along the walls , you know , up a couple of feet . E_S
27670:27	but \[ I , \+ you would n't think that I , N_S

27674:46	well , \[ maybe , \+ maybe \] that *T*-1 understands colors would know all of that stuff E_S
27698:13	we did n't know that when we bought the house *T*-1 E_S
27708:96	And , well , \[ \[ \[ \[ it , \+ it , \] \+ it , \] \+ um , well , it 's \] just , \+ uh , I think 0 it 's just \] \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the \] dark blue to about three feet E_S
27716:50	it kind of bled under the masking tape which , I guess , *T*-1 is probably the topic 0 \[ we 're \+ we 're \] really on to *T*-2 \[ that , \+ that \] the masking is , N_S
27748:13	I do n't know . E_S
27754:20	Um , I 'm not quite sure why that is *T*-1 E_S
27755:10	and it seems like almost a opposite , E_S
27757:34	It did n't have \[ what , \+ you know , I guess 0 *T*-2 what \] I was looking for *T*-1
27772:10	so we probably have an \[ in- , \+ interesting \] perspective on the music on the times , E_S
27784:8	I think 0 \[ with , \+ \] in a way one could talk about Simon and Garfunkel that way because they do tend , uh , *-1 to have a dramatic or story approach to their music , uh , usually tend *-2 to have some good or bad moral to it . E_S
27786:10	and I think 0 that was just through * experiencing contacting college and the fact that I found \[ it , \+ it \] very relaxing for me . E_S
27795:8	I know what I like *-1 to listen to *T*-2 as far as classical music . E_S
27821:44	And I 've developed a real love for , uh , classical music in , probably junior high and high school because my band instructor was , uh , heavy into classical type music . E_S
27824:10	and I think 0 that , uh , got deep seated into me . E_S
27833:15	uh , and I think 0 even Electric Light Orchestra had \[ some , \+ some \] real , um , influences by classical music E_S
27839:13	I do n't know which *T*-1 is chicken and egg in that situation . E_S
27847:52	and both of them , I had as much fascination of the background music , I think 0 *T*-1 going on as I did to the theme of the shows , E_S
27857:16	I 'm kind of thinking 0 that 's maybe , N_S
27857:29	I 'm kind of thinking 0 that 's maybe , N_S
27863:8	I think 0 the title of it was just Downtown , E_S
27876:20	uh , and my family now knows 0 if they come into my study and , uh , I happen *-1 to have had a tough day at work and maybe I 'm trying *-2 to get a project done , uh , at school , uh , and I 'm humming or whistling in a sort of mad crazy way the tune to Downtown they know *-3 to just stay away , E_S
27876:91	uh , and my family now knows 0 if they come into my study and , uh , I happen *-1 to have had a tough day at work and maybe I 'm trying *-2 to get a project done , uh , at school , uh , and I 'm humming or whistling in a sort of mad crazy way the tune to Downtown they know *-3 to just stay away , E_S

27890:10	Uh , probably about first grade , E_S
27894:44	and I have , uh , returned about every four or five years to *-2 thinking that I would like *-1 to do something about it . E_S
27896:49	and then inevitably I am swept *-1 away by \[ the , \+ the \] pressure of other types of things , E_S
27906:26	\[ I , \+ I \] always think that I 'll be able *-1 to do it E_S
27917:48	uh , but \[ in a , \+ in a \] innate music sense there just seems *-1 to be something missing * there which *T*-2 is always frustrating for me since I have pretty high math aptitude E_S
27918:17	and I keep *-2 thinking , gee , I thought that all the math and music people are supposed *-1 to go hand in hand E_S
27918:31	and I keep *-2 thinking , gee , I thought that all the math and music people are supposed *-1 to go hand in hand E_S
27940:26	\[ I just , \+ you know , I can just \] drift off into some other world *-3 just listening to that for hours if I ever have the time 0 * to do that *T*-2 , E_S
27944:5	maybe one of these days , I 'll , N_S you know ,
27944:37	maybe one of these days , I 'll , N_S you know ,
27946:5	maybe one of these days I 'll get around to it , E_S
27948:7	but probably not . N_S
27957:22	Well , it *EXP*-1 's a pleasure * talking with you . E_S
27973:103	I suppose 0 I do because I 've seen a lot of those changes , the changes that women have had *T*-1 in \[ the last genera- , \+ well , you know , not even the last generation , \] the last fifteen years twenty years , * going from , N_S
27983:39	if you were educated \[ you got , \+ you know , you might \] teach for a year or two before you got married *-1 . E_S
27983:47	if you were educated \[ you got , \+ you know , you might \] teach for a year or two before you got married *-1 . E_S
27987:55	And if you really pushed it , you taught until you had kids or something you know , E_S
27991:54	\[ if you had , \+ if you were \] a teacher . Then , you know , that was it , until the kids were little . E_S
27997:89	\[ There was not , \+ there 's not \] supposed *-1 to be any reason 0 * to use this education or this brain that you might have *T*-2 for anything other than your house and your children and how clean can the bathroom floors be *T*-3 on any given day *T*-4 . E_S
28007:127	\[ and , \+ and \] we have these wonderful people \[ who *T*-1 are \+ who *T*-2 are \] totally prepared *-3 \[ to tea- , \+ to teach \] your child everything 0 they need *-4 to know *T*-5 in day care E_S
28013:41	\[ but \+ but , \] uh , a really good day care is probably going *-1 to cost more than you 're going *-2 to make at the job . E_S
28034:65	I could n't put in enough overtime that *T*-1 was necess- , or \[ that , \+ \] you know , things that *T*-2 would come up at work , that *T*-3 would require me to stay late or to come in early or to do something on Saturdays \[ as * is , \+ you know , as * is \] needed *-4 , because my husband for a long time was out of the country also \[ with , \+ uh , with \] work , for like three months E_S

28048:31	Well that 's the thing , see , you know , E_S
28049:5	maybe if you get along E_S
28051:10	You know , the technicians work the eight to five job and know when they 're going *-1 to be there *T*-2 . E_S
28051:37	You know , the technicians work the eight to five job and know when they 're going *-1 to be there *T*-2 . E_S
28054:8	* might have been better . E_S
28087:27	And then \[ I , \+ you know , I \] did that for six years . E_S
28088:77	And then I stayed home with my son , and did nothing . And found out \[ that I was , \+ that , you know , it was \] great , E_S
28106:71	and so \[ they 're getting , \+ they get \] the socialization with other kids , \[ and , \+ you know , and \] not really school , \[ but , \+ but \] a different authority than mom , once in a while , you know , kind of *-2 learning how * to deal with society *T*-1 . E_S

28108:37	\[ And , \+ and \] they need that , you know , *-1 to be able *-2 to relate to other people besides the same person every day . E_S
28111:8	I think 0 they do , too . E_S
28117:30	well , that 's the other thing , you know , E_S
28133:8	I think 0 that 's the thing that we 're going *-1 to see *T*-2 , E_S
28134:13	well , I think 0 the biggest thing 0 we 're going *-4 to see *T*-1 coming up in the next ten year , \[ even in the , \+ \] even now they 're starting *-2 to do it , E_S but I think 0 it 's going *-1 to be more in the next ten to fifteen years , is that there 's going *-3 to be a lot of women , E_S

28149:43	And now , with the photography , \[ that 's , \+ you know , it 's \] working , E_S
28154:93	The thing that I 'm doing *T*-1 is * taking school pictures in day cares and in Mother 's Day Out programs , and also soccer teams , and , you know , different stuff like that . E_S
28165:38	or my husband , \[ if it 's , \+ you know , uh , when he 's \] at home *T*-1 , can take care of them . E_S
28170:8	I think 0 they 're really going *-1 to have *-2 to *?* ,
28177:70	Well , \[ so , \+ so \] that 's another thing that *T*-1 has *-2 to adapt is , you know , \[ the , \+ the \] father 's attitudes about , you know , \[ who , \+ whose \] job is this *T*-3 . E_S

28184:31	because as far as housework goes , you know , men can do housework just as easily as women , E_S
28201:35	Because if he saw mom doing only that you know , all the time 0 he was growing up *T*-1 then it *EXP*-2 's hard * to think of it \[ in \+ \] \[ that , other , \+ uh , that I \] should do it or just to think about * doing it rather than having someone tell him to do it . E_S

28219:8	I know 0 that was a big thing in our house for a long time was that if I wanted my husband to do something *-1 to help , and even though we were both working the same number of hours , \[ and , \+ and \] doing things , I had *-2 to come in there specifically and say this needs *-3 to be done *-4 , E_S
28228:12	And a man might say out loud , well , you know , I understand this E_S
28228:36	And a man might say out loud , well , you know , I understand this E_S
28239:68	Most of the men do n't walk into the kitchen and see that the dishes are there and that yes , you probably ought *-1 to unload the dishwasher and load the new ones in and run it . E_S
28243:25	They \[ just , \+ you know , just \] scoot it on another spot on the sink and put the next plate down , and in a while get around to it . E_S
28244:10	And I think 0 most women walk in \[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ and \] with , Oh , * got *-1 to clean all this up .

28256:149	Which *T*-4 brings us back to the idea , you know , 0 someone 's got *-5 to be there *-6 taking care of the kids *-6 to \[ drill in these \+ you know , drill in the \] right ideas to , so that they know that , uh , you know , male and female are both responsible for *-1 doing this E_S
28256:167	Which *T*-4 brings us back to the idea , you know , 0 someone 's got *-5 to be there *-6 taking care of the kids *-6 to \[ drill in these \+ you know , drill in the \] right ideas to , so that they know that , uh , you know , male and female are both responsible for *-1 doing this E_S
28271:10	And I think 0 \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] going *-1 to show up a lot more now , \[ in the , \+ in the \] next generation \[ of , \+ of \] boys and girls . E_S
28272:177	\[ \[ It 's not , \+ they 're not going *-7 to , \] \+ the boys in this next generation are not going *-1 to \] have *-2 to be told *-3 as much this needs *-4 to be done *-5 , because mom was there *-6 saying that dad is there , you know , E_S
28297:10	But I think 0 in between we got \[ a group of kids , \+ a generation of kids \] who *T*-1 did n't learn *-2 to take responsibility because mom left *-3 to go *-4 get a job and dad did n't move in *-5 to fill the gap . E_S
28302:10	and I think 0 that 's happened in a lot of cases . E_S
28311:16	Un , you know some time day care is really good , E_S
28319:22	It 's someone , you know , keeping an eye on the kids E_S
28320:76	but the kids are basically doing what they want *T*-1 and not really having any relationship with the adults * to say , you know , here 's *T*-3 what *T*-2 's right E_S
28324:24	and here 's *T*-2 what *T*-1 wrong , E_S
28328:8	I think 0 that was one of the main reasons that I quit *T*-1 , was because I wanted my kids to have my values , E_S
28329:169	and I felt like when they were young *T*-1 , that was the time 0 *-2 to instill it *T*-5 . That \[ it could be , \+ it could be \] added to *-3 and strengthened *-3 as they grew older , but 0 when they were little *T*-4 , you know , N_S
28334:66	and this is the way , because \[ \[ I , \+ it 's \] \+ that , \] you know , N_S
28339:74	But if no one does anything when they 're little *T*-1 , then it 's twice as hard \[ as , \+ I think 0 *T*-2 , as \] they get older . E_S
28354:10	You know , my dad was a very traditional dad , E_S
28355:37	and when I was a child *T*-1 I did n't really know my dad very well , E_S
28366:51	\[ Some of the , \+ some of the \] women 's roles , I think 0 *T*-2 , are almost for the worse , because we 're losing out on some things , *-1 going back to work , E_S
28367:10	but I think 0 \[ if we can , \+ if we can \] expand the men 's roles at the same time , like you 're taking care of your child , and your dad probably did n't very often N_S
28367:108	but I think 0 \[ if we can , \+ if we can \] expand the men 's roles at the same time , like you 're taking care of your child , and your dad probably did n't very often N_S
28371:8	I know 0 mine almost never did ... E_S
28381:8	It seems 0 everything 0 I do *T*-1 is computer related . E_S
28430:19	And , um , you know , every now and then the file gets so big , that , you know , it moves slower than I 'd like *?* E_S
28430:59	And , um , you know , every now and then the file gets so big , that , you know , it moves slower than I 'd like *?* E_S
28441:22	And , uh , I do n't know , E_S
28461:46	so I ended up *-1 taking on the load of *-2 making * sure 0 everybody knows what they 're doing *T*-3 E_S
28461:56	so I ended up *-1 taking on the load of *-2 making * sure 0 everybody knows what they 're doing *T*-3 E_S
28482:42	If I had a machine already installed * at home I would probably work just about every night . E_S
28484:74	One of the reasons why I got mine *T*-1 , was 0 before I went on maternity leave , E_S they did n't know how they were going *-1 to do without me *T*-2 at work because , I am pretty much \[ the , \+ like you said , the \] guru , in the office with the different programs and MUMBLEx any trouble shooting that there is *T*-1 , E_S
28491:34	\[ and , \+ um , so \] they did n't know how it was going *-1 to work *T*-2 , E_S
28496:19	But , uh , you know , \[ it 's , \+ uh , it 's \] almost like we could become too dependent on them . E_S
28518:58	It 's remarkable the things 0 we can do *T*-1 now , and compared to , you know , a few years .
28527:22	but , uh , I do n't know if my boss will spring for it . E_S
28536:8	We think about that a lot . E_S
28614:10	And I think 0 it 's called *-1 the desk jet E_S
28615:36	and \[ they 're , \+ you understand , I think 0 they 're \] about five hundred dollars now . E_S
28653:95	and if \[ we want , \+ well in our area , if we want \] *-1 to use it , \[ we have *-2 to , \+ you know , like you said , you had *-3 to \] change it , put it on a disc , And carry it over to there , and see if they 're not using the printer , E_S
28672:8	I know , E_S
28673:8	I know , E_S
28694:15	And I could n't believe when I walked in the door on my first day *T*-3 and here 's *T*-2 the audit department of \[ this , \+ this \] huge holding company , *-1 sharing a H P Rugged Writer . E_S
28727:33	We find it \[ hard 0 * to believe *T*-2 *ICH*-4 sometimes , \+ or hard 0 * to understand *T*-1 \] when , uh , we work for a computer company *T*-3 , and , uh ,
28734:28	ca n't you do that with , you know , what we have *T*-1 , E_S
28797:41	so I have stuck to water aerobics *ICH*-1 *ICH*-4 basically , you know , the weightless thing and , * trying *-3 to keep this shape that way E_S
28801:14	but , you know , it 's hard 0 * to find *T*-1 . E_S
28803:8	I think 0 they feel 0 this is going *-1 to be an effortless sweatless way , 0 * to get in shape , without * having *-3 to spend anything *T*-2 E_S
28816:42	Well , I mean , \[ if , \+ if \] you know what your routine is *T*-1 , you can do that by yourself , E_S
28817:10	and you probably do . E_S
28824:63	So , * to find an indoor pool where either you can do this by yourself without , you know , * drawing a lot of looks *T*-2 , means 0 you 're really going *-1 to do a strenuous workout activity MUMBLEx E_S
28832:11	I can believe that . E_S
28836:12	and you know , that 's the only place I have n't tried E_S
28857:10	Do you know if they have child care there ? E_S
28893:14	and , you know , they did an attitude survey like six weeks after I had been working here E_S
28894:23	and I asked about , you know , day care for the shift workers , E_S
28898:70	and boy I was pulled *-1 in by my manager and told *-1 that you just do n't say that , you know , E_S
28915:10	you know , we still do n't have a day care facility E_S
28952:18	and I do n't even know it . E_S
28961:8	I think 0 that 's kind of when my husband hit the roof , because it was a , uh , thirteen thousand dollar bill *T*-1 , E_S
28976:13	I did not know that since I was on personal leave of absence that I had been , uh , terminated *-1 until I filed my insurance claims about four months later E_S
28979:46	and I said what the hell *T*-1 is going on here , you know . E_S
28984:52	And they told me \[ that , \+ \] uh , oh , well , you know , you know , your husband works here E_S
28984:62	And they told me \[ that , \+ \] uh , oh , well , you know , you know , your husband works here E_S
28986:13	we did n't think that you 'd be coming back anyway , E_S
28987:19	and , uh , you know , we 've got people *ICH*-1 here that *T*-2 really , you know , need *-3 to be working E_S
28987:61	and , uh , you know , we 've got people *ICH*-1 here that *T*-2 really , you know , need *-3 to be working E_S
28988:32	and so that we had just , N_S you know ,
28992:18	I said , you know , I 've got *-1 to put this in writing to me , \[ and \+ \] because until they put it in writing , I could n't get my insurance benefits E_S
29002:26	\[ I , \+ I \] can believe that . E_S
29010:16	I still do n't think that , \[ they \+ \] after my experiences that they could , you know , get me to go back , ever again . E_S
29010:61	I still do n't think that , \[ they \+ \] after my experiences that they could , you know , get me to go back , ever again . E_S
29024:56	I mean , uh , * to add dependents \[ is , \+ is \] you know , maybe another dollar or something E_S
29024:61	I mean , uh , * to add dependents \[ is , \+ is \] you know , maybe another dollar or something E_S
29058:15	but boy , I think 0 I 'm going *-1 to go *-2 contact Texans . E_S
29059:11	I really think 0 I am *?* , E_S
29077:18	Oh , I do n't think 0 that would be bad at all . E_S
29078:27	If you 're in Richardson you 'd probably wanted *-1 to come \[ to the , \+ to the \] Dallas site . E_S
29087:13	and you 'd probably like the pool there . E_S
29090:8	I might do that then . E_S
29115:80	I do see a problem with * graduating people \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 ca n't read and are not , you know , productive in society or productive to themselves E_S
29116:17	and , uh , I think 0 that 's the main problem at this point . E_S
29130:11	something 's wrong . E_S
29131:12	So , I think here in Texas mainly that \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ they 're \] not serious , E_S
29143:13	Um , I think that if from every year \[ when they , \+ when they \] pull in \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the , \] uh , test that the last three years , you know , ten , eleven , twelve \[ year , \+ uh , graders \] take *T*-1 *T*-2 , E_S
29143:130	Um , I think that if from every year \[ when they , \+ when they \] pull in \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the , \] uh , test that the last three years , you know , ten , eleven , twelve \[ year , \+ uh , graders \] take *T*-1 *T*-2 , E_S
29145:26	They 're not saying that something 's wrong with the educational system here in Texas , E_S
29151:67	\[ and then , \+ uh , so \] \[ \[ I 'm , \+ MUMBLEx my opinion \] \+ I think \] 0 there 's a big concern E_S
29153:22	but , uh , I do n't know , E_S
29157:8	I think 0 they get bogged *-1 down in a lot of small issues that \[ people , \+ you know , special interest groups \] can blow *T*-2 up , \[ and , \+ uh , and \] not really get down to * teaching what *T*-3 's important . E_S
29157:70	I think 0 they get bogged *-1 down in a lot of small issues that \[ people , \+ you know , special interest groups \] can blow *T*-2 up , \[ and , \+ uh , and \] not really get down to * teaching what *T*-3 's important . E_S
29161:24	Teaching these kids 0 , you know , \[ how \+ \] MUMBLEx really the basics is what it comes down to *T*-1 . E_S
29168:102	\[ Ha- , \+ \] \[ \[ they do n't even , \+ a lot of the school systems do n't even , \] \+ uh , the kids nowadays do n't even \] know \[ what , \+ what \] the president 's fitness education program is all about *T*-1 , E_S
29198:82	then it comes down to what you said *T*-1 before though about them being some of the lowest paid \[ public , \+ you know , public \] service , employees that there are *T*-2 , E_S
29212:21	she was young , you know , E_S
29220:15	Well , you know , it 's hard though because then you start *-1 talking taxes E_S
29227:8	we might have us a problem . E_S
29245:28	\[ I , \+ uh , I \] think 0 we both agree 0 there 's some problems there E_S
29246:17	but , we 'll , maybe do our small part * to fix them up . E_S
29291:17	And then , you know , usually over lunch , there 'll be a big topic of conversation on something from the news . E_S
29296:44	I normally find that uh , \[ I- , \+ I 'm \] probably the most , um , news hungry of my friends , E_S
29329:33	But \[ he 's , \+ I do n't know , uh , he 's \] \[ \[ mu- , \+ much , \] \+ much \] more so . E_S
29331:34	He was always speaking in terms of , you know , American imperialism reasserting itself . E_S
29343:22	I understand that the MacNeil Lehrer probably does n't . E_S
29349:16	They will have maybe two or three main stories and just spend a very large amount of time . E_S
29368:13	I do n't know the value of that , because I saw plenty of jokes \[ and , \+ and , \] um , oh , editorial cartoons about all the retired generals , making a living during \[ the , \+ the \] Gulf War . E_S
29382:15	and I do n't know anyone in the military E_S
29383:30	and I do n't have a lot of background knowledge in , uh , military strategy \[ and , \+ and \] weaponry , \[ and , \+ and \] all that kind of stuff . E_S
29384:10	And I thought 0 the generals were very interesting . E_S
29385:81	Now when they started *-1 to speculate *T*-2 , \[ I , \+ I \] saw that for what is was *T*-3 , and thought 0 all of these guys do n't know what *T*-4 's going on . E_S
29385:105	Now when they started *-1 to speculate *T*-2 , \[ I , \+ I \] saw that for what is was *T*-3 , and thought 0 all of these guys do n't know what *T*-4 's going on . E_S
29389:10	But I thought 0 \[ \[ the- , \+ the- , \] \+ they \] were interesting , E_S
29395:62	Um , \[ \[ it , \+ it , \] \+ it *EXP*-3 \] was very interesting that it seemed like some of the commentators had their axe 0 * to grind *T*-1 , you know , E_S
29395:114	Um , \[ \[ it , \+ it , \] \+ it *EXP*-3 \] was very interesting that it seemed like some of the commentators had their axe 0 * to grind *T*-1 , you know , E_S
29401:10	And they seemed *-1 to mold the events to their view of the world , which I suppose 0 just about everyone does *T*-2 , E_S
29404:10	You know , one of the best television news shows that I saw *T*-1 during the war was a show on a Saturday morning on A B C , E_S
29413:43	They had them all , uh , on , E_S I do n't know what *ICH*-2 you 'd call it *T*-1 other than *RNR*-3 on line . E_S
29434:8	I thought 0 that was a really unusual thing . E_S
29437:13	I do n't know if it 's H E B statewide or whatever , E_S
29439:13	I do n't know if they still have them , E_S
29458:45	Again *-2 not having , uh , lived through another war , I do n't know if that 's a common thing that people thought of *T*-1 , E_S or if that was a new concern with people . E_S
29458:75	Again *-2 not having , uh , lived through another war , I do n't know if that 's a common thing that people thought of *T*-1 , E_S or if that was a new concern with people . E_S
29471:15	So I do n't think 0 there 's ever been a war that *T*-1 's been so thoroughly covered *-2 by the news . E_S
29473:7	And probably more importantly , one that *T*-1 lasted short enough \[ that , \+ that \] people 's interest did n't flag too badly . E_S
29512:65	so \[ I , \+ I 'm \] pretty much limited *-2 to P B S , which \[ I thought , \+ I thought \] 0 *T*-1 they did a very good job . E_S
29512:76	so \[ I , \+ I 'm \] pretty much limited *-2 to P B S , which \[ I thought , \+ I thought \] 0 *T*-1 they did a very good job . E_S
29571:32	And \[ my , \+ My \] fiancee takes probably six Sunday papers . E_S
29583:19	And , so , you know , he has these stacks of Sunday newspapers that *T*-1 go *-2 unread ... E_S
29586:33	um , I guess , um , 0 this is probably really a good subject for me because I really like *-1 to do , uh , hand work . E_S
29599:8	It seem like that 's , N_S
29645:14	but , you know , it was a lot of fun , too . E_S
29671:59	What I did *T*-1 , when I was doing that *T*-2 was mostly pillows , you know , for sofas and so forth , E_S
29678:15	but I did n't know if it 's been my color choice or multiple moves \[ or , \+ or \] what , E_S
29694:11	I 've probably seen it , though , E_S
29702:55	I mean , when you described it *T*-1 , it sounded like something , you know , that *T*-2 would be around , I guess 0 *T*-3 . E_S
29719:14	How did you know *-1 to choose this subject , tonight *T*-2 . E_S
29730:38	Um . I really wanted *-1 to do , N_S you know ,
29731:44	so many of them now have the ribbons where , I 'm not sure how they do it *T*-1 *T*-2 , E_S
29734:13	I do n't know how *-1 to explain it *T*-2 . E_S
29735:25	They make them hard , you know ? E_S
29750:67	I suspect 0 they 're fairly simple , because the one lady 0 I 've seen *T*-1 , 0 I know that *T*-2 does it , I 've never asked her any questions , E_S
29766:10	and it may be something similar to that that the fabric is dipped *-1 in *T*-2 and then , um , allowed *-1 to dry in \[ \[ those , \+ those draping bows , \] \+ I mean , those draping streamers . \]
29767:13	I do n't know . E_S
29777:22	\[ That 's \+ I think 0 that 's \] what my concern was *T*-1 , was it really sure , and \[ how they would , \+ how they would \] last *T*-2 . E_S
29777:65	\[ That 's \+ I think 0 that 's \] what my concern was *T*-1 , was it really sure , and \[ how they would , \+ how they would \] last *T*-2 . E_S
29781:10	Do you know what my concern is *T*-1 ? E_S
29805:8	I know . E_S
29807:21	So first thing 0 I think of *T*-1 is how easy *ICH*-4 would this , thing be *T*-2 0 * to clean *T*-3 . E_S
29826:67	But I really enjoy it when I do do it *T*-1 , when I get the chance *T*-2 , you know . E_S
29841:8	I know , E_S
29857:12	and you know , \[ I 've , \+ I have \] worked on it quite a bit , but not as much as I 'd like *-1 to *?* . E_S
29858:10	You know , it 's just so hard . E_S
29865:52	and so \[ it 's really , \+ since it 's counted *-1 , you know , it 's really \] a lot of work . E_S
29869:11	I do know . E_S
29893:11	I 'm probably going *-1 to hear about it the rest of my life . E_S
29895:16	Oh , I 'm sure 0 you 'll get it done , E_S
29896:13	but it just may not of the original , N_S
29901:31	\[ I , \+ I \] just do n't know when I 'm ever , N_S
29902:11	it just seems like there 's just never enough time * to pick it up and do it , E_S you know ,
29902:69	it just seems like there 's just never enough time * to pick it up and do it , E_S you know ,
29913:85	And \[ there 's , \+ there 's \] so many other things that , \[ I , \+ I \] have done *T*-1 , you know , in the meantime , like I said , so many baby gifts . E_S
29915:17	and so , you know , those do n't take much time at all . E_S
29929:11	Usually I think 0 it 's a little bit cheaper in the long run , E_S
29935:52	And \[ it , \+ it \] depends on what it is *T*-1 , you know . E_S
29936:32	But some things , especially letters , if they suggest certain colors for letters , I just go with whatever I want *-1 to *?* *T*-2 . E_S
29946:20	Real simple ones , you know , I do *T*-1 . E_S
29952:53	I mean , \[ just , \+ just \] * did a thumb print . You know . E_S
29960:46	And then , see I did n't cross stitch the actual thumb print , E_S you know ,
29983:109	\[ I , \+ I \] try *-1 to refrain from their use as much as possible . Um , for a number of reasons , one of which *T*-2 is the , you know , extreme interest rate on most of them . E_S
29987:84	The one 0 I use *T*-1 , uh , of course , \[ for \+ mostly , only for \] business purposes is , uh , you know , American Express . E_S
29996:36	Plus \[ it , uh , has , \+ you know , from an economic point of view it has \] increased our debt tremendously to the tune of somewhere on the order of five to ten billion , I believe 0 *T*-1 E_S
29996:121	Plus \[ it , uh , has , \+ you know , from an economic point of view it has \] increased our debt tremendously to the tune of somewhere on the order of five to ten billion , I believe 0 *T*-1 E_S
30013:87	Well , \[ we , \+ uh , me and my wife , \] \[ when , \+ when \] we have like extra money that we know 0 we 're going *-1 to have *T*-2 , and we can put it in our budget *T*-3 , yeah , \[ we 'll , \+ we 'll \] use it . E_S
30014:20	But like last year , I think 0 we paid , N_S
30015:8	I think 0 it was like twenty something cents interest , on our Visa . E_S
30021:12	And I think \[ this , \+ this \] year \[ we , \+ uh , I think 0 *T*-1 we \] used it for Christmas , E_S
30021:55	And I think \[ this , \+ this \] year \[ we , \+ uh , I think 0 *T*-1 we \] used it for Christmas , E_S
30023:56	\[ And , \+ uh , so \] we 'll pay a little interest *ICH*-1 this year , but maybe two dollars . E_S
30028:14	And , you know , \[ we , \+ I think 0 we \] feel about the same way 0 you do *T*-1 real strongly . E_S
30028:34	And , you know , \[ we , \+ I think 0 we \] feel about the same way 0 you do *T*-1 real strongly . E_S
30031:10	and I think 0 we have a couple of department stores . E_S
30043:89	But , uh , \[ I try , \+ \[ a- , \+ as \] with the American Express , I try \] *-1 to pay it , you know , as it comes in . E_S
30053:8	I know 0 \[ when I travel *T*-1 , \+ or when I used *-2 to travel overseas quite a bit *T*-3 , \] what I would do *T*-4 on my American Express card is \[ before I would , \+ before I left \] I would mail a check \[ to , \+ to \] American Express and , you know , have some idea of how much *T*-5 was there , you know ,

30054:24	I 'd sent them , you know , several hundred dollars , or whatever I felt 0 I would spend *T*-6 . And then use it then . E_S
30076:22	\[ Sometimes , \+ you know , sometimes \] I would go over , E_S
30077:30	but \[ it would n't , \+ you know , it would n't \] hit me \[ in a big , \+ in a big \] way because I knew that , uh , I would have it covered *-1 in that respect . E_S
30084:29	\[ I 've , \+ I do n't think 0 we 've \] gone that far MUMBLEx , *-1 to pay it \[ in ad- , \+ you know , in advance \] before we spend it , E_S

30110:77	Uh , for example , I remember 0 on one trip to France when I started *-1 planning the trip *T*-2 , I think , uh , a dollar was worth nine or ten E_S francs and just in a matter of a week or two the dollar fell against the franc , drastically . E_S
30123:48	but , uh uh , \[ I , \+ I \] was anticipating , you know , 0 my room would cost , uh , * let 's say N_S
30127:76	if it were , say sixty or seventy francs a night that would mean 0 it would be about ten dollars or so , or maybe twenty dolls- , E_S
30131:5	maybe it would be more than that . E_S
30152:27	So there 's a little consternation , you know , in * trying *-1 to get them to compensate , for the difference in the exchange rate . E_S
30162:111	\[ And I , \+ But as I \] said , \[ most , \+ most \] of all I try not *-1 to use them , uh , \[ to any , \+ \] you know , lavishly , in that regard . E_S
30194:13	Well , I know Jack Godfrey . E_S
30198:8	I know him very well . E_S
30199:11	I 've known Jack for a long time , E_S
30243:8	I think 0 we talked for a good eight minutes about the subject , E_S
30244:12	so , I think 0 you get ten , E_S
30245:10	so I think 0 we 're okay . E_S
30277:48	I work with one \[ on , \+ at \] work continually , you know , E_S
30302:11	It 's probably pretty close to what I have *T*-1 , because I have the same kind of thing at work . E_S
30326:18	We have , you know , used some of it for some personal things . E_S
30341:10	You know , I mean , she just , you know , N_S
30341:38	You know , I mean , she just , you know , N_S
30342:31	I expected *-1 to go and , you know , drop the stuff off and go back two weeks later . E_S
30343:14	And , you know , she had it done *-1 and out in twenty minutes on her little P C . E_S
30355:14	I have often thought \[ that , \+ that \] *-1 having one at home would be neat . E_S
30356:16	I just do n't know if we would really use it that much . You know . E_S
30356:50	I just do n't know if we would really use it that much . You know . E_S
30363:22	\[ Then , \+ you know , then , \] we thought , well we can use it for , you know , some personal things . E_S

30365:31	for us it *EXP*-1 really took , you know , a business application * to justify the expense of it . E_S
30372:8	I know 0 my stepfather bought my mother a little personal computer , oh , I guess *RNR*-1 , probably three years ago for Christmas , E_S
30372:60	I know 0 my stepfather bought my mother a little personal computer , oh , I guess *RNR*-1 , probably three years ago for Christmas , E_S
30373:14	and , you know , it 's got some stuff on it . E_S
30374:42	It 's got a nice little word processing software on it , you know , and some budgeting type things and stuff . E_S
30375:15	And I do n't think 0 she 's ever touched it you know . E_S
30375:42	And I do n't think 0 she 's ever touched it you know . E_S
30379:30	\[ It just , \+ it just \] seems like a lot of trouble for something at home . E_S
30380:10	You know , she always seems *-3 to have better things 0 *-4 to do *T*-1 than *-4 to try *-5 to sit down and figure out how * to use her computer *T*-2 you know . E_S

30391:11	Now I know 0 my boss has bought the software , um , \[ that he can , \+ that his \] checkbook is \[ \[ on , \+ on \] \+ on \] a disk , E_S
30397:44	and he 's ordered envelopes with the windows in the right places you know , E_S
30401:28	and he just whips , out , you know , N_S
30404:20	and he just , you know , wrote all the checks on the screen and hit print E_S
30406:20	and he just , you know , N_S
30415:10	You know , and he said , you know , I can balance my checkbook in seconds , you know because it 's all in the computer , you know . E_S

30421:12	And you know there 's not going *-1 to be those adding mistakes that we all make *T*-2 . E_S

30426:10	You know , it does it for you . E_S
30427:19	So . This , you know , N_S
30433:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 in most cases I 'd have *-1 to say no . E_S
30456:15	now 0 I think about it , E_S I guess 0 \[ for , \+ for \] kids like , as they get older , N_S especially now when they get to junior \[ high school , \+ high school , \] and even college *T*-1 . N_S
30473:18	I 'm , you know , going part time in the evenings , E_S
30474:14	and , you know , I do , N_S
30478:29	You have *-1 to type it you know , E_S
30482:43	\[ and , \+ and so \] I 'm up here , you know , nights and weekends you know , *-1 working \[ on the little p- , \+ on the P C \] up here , you know , typing stuff . E_S

30483:63	So I can see where it would be a great advantage * to have one at home , you know , if you were going to school *T*-1 . E_S
30486:21	any more I do n't even know \[ if they have , \+ if a college kid would have \] a typewriter . E_S
30489:13	I do n't know . E_S
30496:10	and they probably used *-1 to have it . E_S
30502:28	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't know what they used *-1 to do *T*-2 before they , N_S
30546:10	You know , I remember when I was working in high school *T*-1 , you know ,

30548:25	I continued *-1 working there for probably another year . E_S
30553:23	But it 's amazing , you know , E_S
30554:36	then , when , \[ where , \+ \] you know , someone would have you type a letter *T*-1 , \[ they did it right , \+ they did it right . \] E_S
30564:17	and now , you know people just send it back over and over and over and over . E_S
30566:11	That 's probably one of the problems and frustrations that it 's brought *T*-1 about , because people do feel like , Oh well , we can just change it . E_S
30575:14	instead of * knowing what they want *-1 to say *T*-2 before \[ they eve- , \+ they just , \] you know , play with it , \[ and , \+ which \] in a way *-3 is nice * to be able 0 * to do *T*-4 , E_S

30579:14	but , you know , \[ it , \+ it \] gets a little out of hand sometimes . E_S
30580:43	I 've seen it get out of hand up here , you know where we 've got a secretary that *T*-1 sits over here that *T*-4 's keeping metrics right now , and keeping up , you know , of all the letters 0 I type *T*-2 , \[ how many cha- , \+ how many \] of them *T*-6 do I make changes on *T*-3 .

30586:48	or people just change \[ a , \+ like , one \] word because they think 0 it sounds better , or whatever . E_S
30587:14	And , you know , she 's also keeping \[ a percentage , \+ you know , what percentage \] of letters am I retyping *T*-1 for whatever reason . E_S
30587:51	And , you know , she 's also keeping \[ a percentage , \+ you know , what percentage \] of letters am I retyping *T*-1 for whatever reason . E_S
30591:67	And there 's like one week , 0 she did retypes on ninety percent of what she typed *T*-1 you know , E_S
30593:8	I believe it . E_S
30595:31	and \[ it 's like , \+ you know , it 's \] ridiculous E_S
30605:10	You know , she \[ keeps , \+ you know keeps \] several weeks ' worth of data and then in addition is keeping copies of all the changes *-2 to show , you know , * look , this did n't really need *-1 to be changed *-3 . E_S

30607:12	and you know , *-1 changing , * add this time to now . E_S
30610:10	You know , I mean , that 's the kind of things , you know , that she 's keeping *T*-1 and showing , that , this was a big waste of time , it was a waste of paper , it *EXP*-2 was a waste , you know * to change something like that . E_S
30610:50	You know , I mean , that 's the kind of things , you know , that she 's keeping *T*-1 and showing , that , this was a big waste of time , it was a waste of paper , it *EXP*-2 was a waste , you know * to change something like that . E_S

30614:19	So . Anyway , \[ maybe , \+ you know , maybe \] \[ it 'll , \+ it 'll \] help in some way , E_S
30614:32	So . Anyway , \[ maybe , \+ you know , maybe \] \[ it 'll , \+ it 'll \] help in some way , E_S
30614:37	So . Anyway , \[ maybe , \+ you know , maybe \] \[ it 'll , \+ it 'll \] help in some way , E_S
30615:15	but I do n't know . E_S
30624:17	and so , you know , some day I would like *-1 to get , even just like the video \[ tell , \+ \] or something like that , you know ,
30624:96	and so , you know , some day I would like *-1 to get , even just like the video \[ tell , \+ \] or something like that , you know ,
30626:10	You know so , N_S
30628:33	Especially when they 're in school *T*-1 , I think 0 *T*-2 they would get a lot out of it . E_S
30633:10	you know , that sounds like such a great idea , E_S
30634:10	you know , it *ICH*-1 'd be kind of fun * to be able *-2 to play with it . E_S
30635:13	So . I know , 0 my father had a P C , E_S
30639:71	But you could link in and \[ talk to other peo- , \+ talk to people \] all over the country , you know . E_S
30643:38	And , like , you have your own little code name , you know , E_S
30648:28	and it was just great fun , you know , E_S
30649:71	It was very expensive , because the whole time 0 you were on there *T*-1 you were on long distance , you know . E_S
30654:47	So , we were each limited *-1 to like twenty minutes a day , you know , E_S
30661:15	Well , you know , \[ we , \+ my parents \] were divorced *-1 E_S
30662:57	and so the time 0 we were like visiting our father in the summer time *T*-1 , you know , E_S
30667:11	I 'm sure 0 we would not have been allowed *-1 to do that under normal situations , you know . E_S
30667:63	I 'm sure 0 we would not have been allowed *-1 to do that under normal situations , you know . E_S
30668:40	But when you 're doing the guilty father complex *T*-1 , you know , because he 's not there *-2 to watch us grow , you can kind of get all kinds of stuff . E_S
30707:35	and it did n't get \[ as , \+ you know , as \] good a reviews as like the LITTLE MERMAID , their last one ,
30709:29	But this one \[ was , \+ I thought was \] excellent . E_S
30716:15	And I ca n't believe how good they 're getting *T*-1 with their animation now . E_S
30717:43	It 's \[ just , \+ just \] the special effects , you know . E_S
30720:46	\[ and , \+ uh , and \] it 's a huge eagle , you know , wing span of twenty feet or something like that . E_S
30722:28	and he rides through the clouds , you know , E_S
30724:24	and \[ it , \+ you know , they 're \] flying all over with it . E_S
30725:20	And I mean , I know 0 \[ they , \+ there \] must have \[ used , \+ been \] computers or something for animation this day , E_S
30740:54	that was made *-1 \[ in \+ \] \[ a few , \+ I do n't know , several \] years back , I guess 0 *T*-2 . E_S
30745:57	\[ Latest , \+ latest \] one 0 I 've saw *T*-1 which *T*-2 was a mistake *-3 to go *-4 see was LIONHEART , E_S
30767:31	Or he 's singular I guess , you know . E_S
30768:8	You know how they can make \[ any of , \+ any single one of \] them in a movie to be a \[ super \+ superstar \] of any sort *T*-1 , you know , E_S
30768:109	You know how they can make \[ any of , \+ any single one of \] them in a movie to be a \[ super \+ superstar \] of any sort *T*-1 , you know , E_S

30851:13	Um , I thought 0 an excellent one , too , was MISERY with Kathy Bates and James Caan . E_S
30868:21	\[ and , \+ you know , and \] P G -s used *-1 to be R -s E_S

30880:25	it 's just that the rating system seems , you know ,
30880:35	it 's just that the rating system seems , you know ,
30885:46	They just changed it because X had a connotation with it , you know , E_S
30900:8	that seems *-1 to be the norm of most movies , E_S
30923:8	I thought 0 the book was better than the movie , E_S
30924:10	but I thought 0 the movie was really good as well . E_S
30931:44	I read about one or two thick novels like that a year . You know , E_S
30936:24	But that was a good show I thought 0 *T*-1 , you know . E_S
30936:40	But that was a good show I thought 0 *T*-1 , you know . E_S
30938:10	You know , that *ICH*-2 was n't a real submarine 0 you saw *T*-1 in the water . E_S
30944:8	I thought , you know , N_S

30945:63	it looked to me like it was a real submarine , that *T*-1 was in the water , you know . E_S
30970:18	oh , I 'm not sure . E_S
30975:26	and he uses all of his special effects knowledge in *-1 doing what *T*-2 needs *-3 to be done *-4 . E_S
30998:13	I do n't know if they have the , uh , original actors on that first one to that one . E_S
31010:84	\[ I mean , Hollywood , \+ I mean they \] were doing their dealings with that before they even got over there , I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
31014:25	in some of those , you know , \[ they , \+ I guess they \] retitled some movies that *T*-1 were going *-2 to be about Lebanese \[ \[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ you know , and , \] \+ and \] Americans E_S

31128:61	and I was never one 0 *T*-2 to believe everything 0 my kids said *T*-1 , you know , about something . E_S
31132:22	and yet others 0 I know *T*-1 are just wonderful . E_S
31136:109	It *EXP*-2 was told *-1 to me or suggested *-1 to me , uh , that * to work as a teacher in the public school systems in the state of Texas , E_S and I think 0 it 's similar \[ in , \+ in \] many other states , if you have a degree in a technical field you do not need a teaching certificate because there is such a shortage of , uh , people 0 *T*-1 to teach math and sciences . E_S
31140:26	And somebody said , well , you know , you could go in \[ and , \+ and \] substitute teach at seventy-five dollars a day E_S
31141:36	and there 's always going *-1 to be , you know , somebody having a need for a math or science teacher . E_S
31142:8	I thought , Christ , they 're letting me in , * to , you know , N_S
31142:50	I thought , Christ , they 're letting me in , * to , you know , N_S
31147:13	I do n't know anything about it . E_S
31149:43	That 's pretty interesting \[ because just , \+ just because \] you know a subject matter does n't mean 0 you can teach it . E_S
31157:53	And even if I knew how * to teach the subject matter *T*-1 , I do n't know if I 'd know how * to handle that kind of \[ a , \+ a \] group of kids *T*-2 . E_S
31157:66	And even if I knew how * to teach the subject matter *T*-1 , I do n't know if I 'd know how * to handle that kind of \[ a , \+ a \] group of kids *T*-2 . E_S
31160:16	In fact , I think 0 \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] one of the big problems today is \[ the , \+ the \] way 0 the kids behave or act *T*-2 \[ and , \+ and \] the way 0 they are sometimes disinterested in what *T*-1 's going on in the class and disruptive *T*-3 . E_S
31163:23	and this comes from , you know , \[ the , \+ the \] aging hippie near forty mother . E_S
31164:36	So I went through this period of supposedly , you know , cosmic social enlightenment . E_S
31172:20	And I used *-1 to think , well , that 's wonderful . E_S
31173:10	You know , they can get a real life experience . E_S
31178:92	And I wonder , how do they handle a child who *T*-1 is obviously very ready and another child who *T*-2 does n't even speak English , let alone know her colors *T*-3 . E_S
31184:15	My God , I think 0 it would be next year is what I 'd read *T*-1 . E_S
31185:8	I thought , well , \[ how do you , \+ how do you \] weed those out *T*-1 ? E_S

31308:50	This is the kid \[ who , \+ who \] *T*-1 really , you know , barely made it through high school . E_S
31312:17	And I keep *-1 thinking , you know , \[ it 's not , \+ it 's really not \] too late *ICH*-2 at any point * to do , you know , some- , N_S

31336:64	\[ and , \+ and \] part of me says 0 I just would like *-1 to , you know , shut my eyes and pretend 0 it does n't , you know , go on . Or send them to private schools . E_S

31337:54	And then \[ the , \+ you know , the \] old social conscience says , you know , I 'm not working ,
31339:31	Maybe I should volunteer *-1 to , you know , teach what I know *T*-2 . E_S
31339:47	Maybe I should volunteer *-1 to , you know , teach what I know *T*-2 . E_S

31343:71	Maybe adult literacy . Maybe , you know , composition writing . Maybe , you know , uh , * volunteering , you know , on a tutor line or though \[ the , \+ even through the \] elementary schools for help with homework E_S
31349:24	So , uh , what do you think *T*-1 about it ? E_S
31360:97	Well , there is always \[ the , \+ uh , the \] possibility , even remote as it is *?* , \[ \[ of , \+ uh , of \] mistaken , \+ uh , of , \] N_S
31362:38	\[ That 's , \+ of course , that is \] certainly true , E_S
31387:13	I do n't know how that 's going *-1 to affect , uh , E_S
31402:45	\[ and , \+ and , \] uh , \[ we , \+ you know , we \] do have the random drug testing E_S
31405:42	And what *T*-1 happens \[ \[ if it , \+ you know , if it , \] \+ if they \] catch it , E_S
31406:8	they think that \[ I 'm , \+ you know , I 'm \] on drugs E_S
31406:36	they think that \[ I 'm , \+ you know , I 'm \] on drugs E_S
31407:52	and they send me \[ and , \+ and \] have me , uh , you know , go through \[ this , \+ this , \] thing , you know , E_S
31407:92	and they send me \[ and , \+ and \] have me , uh , you know , go through \[ this , \+ this , \] thing , you know , E_S
31413:14	But it *EXP*-2 seems to me that there are ways 0 * to accommodate that *T*-1 . Um , E_S
31414:37	I agree \[ that , \+ that \] some innocent person might be victimized *-1 , by a false test , E_S
31418:13	but I would think \[ that , \+ um , that \] some guidelines could be set *-1 up * to avoid that . E_S
31419:81	For example , that one , uh , positive would not be , uh , accepted *-1 as an automatic , um , reason for whatever they might be going , *-2 to do *T*-6 if they found a positive , uh , dismissal or treatment or whatever , but \[ that , \+ that \] what it would do *T*-3 is it would trigger , perhaps , uh , one or two more stages where further tests could be \[ ta- , \+ \] uh , done *-4 *T*-5 . E_S
31426:119	Because , um , \[ there are , \+ there must \] be people like you , or in other circumstances , that *T*-1 could come up \[ with , \+ with , \] uh , false positives for certain kind of drugs . E_S
31427:25	On the other hand , um , I think 0 there 's certainly some professions that *T*-1 ought *-2 to be tested *-3 because \[ of the , \+ of their \] responsibility for the public welfare , and certainly people in , uh , industries , well , the transportation industry , \[ for spe- , \+ uh , you know , specifically . \] E_S
31427:38	On the other hand , um , I think 0 there 's certainly some professions that *T*-1 ought *-2 to be tested *-3 because \[ of the , \+ of their \] responsibility for the public welfare , and certainly people in , uh , industries , well , the transportation industry , \[ for spe- , \+ uh , you know , specifically . \] E_S
31427:117	On the other hand , um , I think 0 there 's certainly some professions that *T*-1 ought *-2 to be tested *-3 because \[ of the , \+ of their \] responsibility for the public welfare , and certainly people in , uh , industries , well , the transportation industry , \[ for spe- , \+ uh , you know , specifically . \] E_S

31437:120	But , um , in \[ many , \+ many \] cases whether or not an individual has a problem with drugs , it 's not even going *-1 to effect anybody but \[ his , \+ uh , you know , himself \] and his own family , perhaps , um , depending on the kind of drug 0 he might be on *T*-2 . E_S
31437:179	But , um , in \[ many , \+ many \] cases whether or not an individual has a problem with drugs , it 's not even going *-1 to effect anybody but \[ his , \+ uh , you know , himself \] and his own family , perhaps , um , depending on the kind of drug 0 he might be on *T*-2 . E_S
31446:122	I guess 0 \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ uh , I \] would not want *-1 to have anyone in my family , uh , victimized *-4 by \[ someone who , \+ you know , \[ a , \+ a \] bus driver or a train engineer or something like that , who , \] um , you know , *T*-2 had n't been tested *-3 . E_S

31449:31	Well , \[ \[ I , \+ you know , I 'm , \] \+ like I said , \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] \] very much pro testing , um , E_S
31455:8	I know 0 this sounds like a slogan for the government , E_S
31456:24	but \[ I , \+ you know , we \] are in a war against , drugs . E_S
31464:23	I mean , you do n't know whether the person sitting next to you anywhere is on drugs or not , E_S
31472:10	And I think , personally , 0 the drastic step has *-1 to be \[ that , \+ um , that \] you ca n't work if you continue *-2 taking drugs . E_S
31487:15	or at least it seems that way . E_S
31497:14	We really only know of one , uh , young man \[ who , \+ uh , who *T*-1 's \] a fam- , N_S
31504:32	and he 's really the only one that I know of *T*-1 personally who *T*-2 got himself really messed *-3 up , um , * \[ ha- , \+ having \] been involved *-4 with drugs . E_S
31505:10	But I know of a number of other people who *T*-1 have , you know , gotten all messed *-2 up . E_S
31505:49	But I know of a number of other people who *T*-1 have , you know , gotten all messed *-2 up . E_S
31516:10	and he may never really be a productive member of society . E_S
31517:26	But * sadder than that , he may never be able *-1 to have a normal , happy life because it has strung him out so that he has anxieties *ICH*-3 now that *T*-2 \[ are , \+ are \] almost uncontrollable . E_S
31518:56	I mean , \[ he , \+ he \] puts himself in the hospital fairly regularly *-1 thinking that , you know , \[ he , \+ he 's \] not sure if he 's going *-2 try *-3 to commit suicide or not . E_S
31518:69	I mean , \[ he , \+ he \] puts himself in the hospital fairly regularly *-1 thinking that , you know , \[ he , \+ he 's \] not sure if he 's going *-2 try *-3 to commit suicide or not . E_S
31518:98	I mean , \[ he , \+ he \] puts himself in the hospital fairly regularly *-1 thinking that , you know , \[ he , \+ he 's \] not sure if he 's going *-2 try *-3 to commit suicide or not . E_S
31522:36	I mean , \[ he 's , \+ you know , he 's \] so messed up . E_S
31526:52	And , um , this was a nice , sweet , young man who , teenager , you know , N_S
31527:76	and he 's now a young man about twenty , I guess 0 *T*-2 , who , um , *T*-1 just got really down the wrong path . E_S
31531:19	And , uh , you know , I do n't know \[ that , \+ that \] his problem would ever have been detected *-1 by drug testing . E_S
31531:32	And , uh , you know , I do n't know \[ that , \+ that \] his problem would ever have been detected *-1 by drug testing . E_S
31532:97	But * seeing what drugs did *T*-1 to him \[ makes me see , \+ makes me realize \] what it could do *T*-2 to people , you know , in the work force as well . E_S
31540:47	What limits *T*-1 ought *-2 to be put *-3 on it , do you think 0 *T*-4 ? E_S
31542:37	Well , the limits , uh , uh , would , I think 0 *T*-5 , have *-3 to do with what I 'd alluded to *T*-1 before , \[ that there needs *-6 to be a further , \+ um , \[ that , \+ that \] one positive \] on a drug test , would not constitute , uh , dismissal or grounds for whatever the company or agency might , uh , have *T*-4 set up for those who *T*-2 genuinely have a problem . E_S
31542:211	Well , the limits , uh , uh , would , I think 0 *T*-5 , have *-3 to do with what I 'd alluded to *T*-1 before , \[ that there needs *-6 to be a further , \+ um , \[ that , \+ that \] one positive \] on a drug test , would not constitute , uh , dismissal or grounds for whatever the company or agency might , uh , have *T*-4 set up for those who *T*-2 genuinely have a problem . E_S
31560:41	and there needs *-1 to be \[ some , \+ some \] measure of , uh , certainty before anything drastic happens . E_S
31560:54	and there needs *-1 to be \[ some , \+ some \] measure of , uh , certainty before anything drastic happens . E_S
31564:81	There are lots of things that *T*-1 are involved *-2 there , um , such as , perhaps , \[ insurance \+ uh , you know , denial of insurance \] for someone , um , E_S
31568:87	and undoubtedly there are people who *T*-1 would be victimized *-2 by this , um , \[ that *T*-3 would , \+ that , \] you know , N_S
31570:63	and people who *T*-1 are on medication , for example , or , um , even people who *T*-2 might be of the gay community , N_S
31572:17	but , um , I think that there does n't need *-1 to be fuel to the fire for discrimination E_S
31577:10	so it seems to me \[ that , \+ that , \] um , there needs *-1 to be \[ some ground , \+ you know , some rules \] that *T*-2 protect . E_S
31577:80	so it seems to me \[ that , \+ that , \] um , there needs *-1 to be \[ some ground , \+ you know , some rules \] that *T*-2 protect . E_S
31581:13	I 'm not sure *ICH*-4 , though , when we talk about what rules , if any *T*-3 , that we should say , well , certain segments should not have *-1 to be tested *-2 . E_S
31581:81	I 'm not sure *ICH*-4 , though , when we talk about what rules , if any *T*-3 , that we should say , well , certain segments should not have *-1 to be tested *-2 . E_S
31584:13	Personally , I think 0 that 's what I was about *-1 to say *T*-2 is that everyone needs *-3 to be tested *-4 . E_S
31591:34	\[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] know why it *EXP*-1 would be , you know , uh , bad * to test just every- *T*-2 , E_S

31593:15	It , you know , N_S
31595:14	and it *EXP*-2 may be , you know , N_S 0 it *EXP*-1 's not feasible * to do everyone , E_S
31595:27	and it *EXP*-2 may be , you know , N_S 0 it *EXP*-1 's not feasible * to do everyone , E_S
31596:7	but certainly random testing , the fact that people know \[ that , \+ that \] they , N_S
31596:29	but certainly random testing , the fact that people know \[ that , \+ that \] they , N_S
31604:13	would be some measure of protection . N_S
31611:71	Well , \[ \[ there 's , \+ yeah , there , \] \+ there 's \] going *-1 to be some measure of incentive , uh , reward or whatever , E_S
31628:8	I think so . E_S
31631:13	\[ I think 0 we , \+ I think 0 we \] did pretty good . E_S

31698:58	it 's not worth * getting all mad and fighting and hollering at each other when it goes wrong *T*-1 . E_S

32241:24	it just takes up , you know , like you say , a lot of your garden area . E_S
32282:26	we , just wait until , you know , the weather warm enough * to stick it in the ground . E_S

32597:46	And I 'm hoping especially with those big tall sides on there it that maybe \[ I wo n't have , \+ oh , I 'll have \] less of a bug problem E_S
32603:28	so I built a box up , you know

32640:8	you know what I mean *T*-1 . E_S
32643:61	When we had our pool done *-1 *T*-2 I had them to leave some extra loam , you know , for my garden E_S

32734:61	We 've had a garden *ICH*-1 , gosh , for years and years and years , of some size , you know , E_S
32743:10	you know tomatoes that *T*-1 are starting *-2 to bloom N_S
32797:17	those onions , I think , \[ we , \+ we \] planted like twice as much this year because , you know , we got , \[ on- , \+ onions \] E_S
32797:71	those onions , I think , \[ we , \+ we \] planted like twice as much this year because , you know , we got , \[ on- , \+ onions \] E_S
32798:23	and they lasted from , you know , \[ about \+ when you harvest them *T*-1 about \] a month from now or so , or six weeks , from now , \[ until , \+ until \] like October , E_S
32834:8	we sure do . E_S
32839:84	One nice thing with onions \[ and , \+ and \] bell peppers at least you can chop them and freeze them if you have , you know , too many . E_S
32913:25	you do n't \[ get , \+ seem *-1 to get \] that much for the space , E_S
32958:8	I know it . E_S
32960:35	they 're just a bunch of little cucumbers , you know ? E_S
32962:13	I do n't know unless it , labor intensive or something . E_S
32965:18	I really , do n't know . E_S
32978:38	I 'd like *-1 to \[ try , \+ you know , just try \] something new *ICH*-2 , every year that , I have n't tried *T*-3 before E_S
33017:18	Well , um , I think 0 it would probably depend on whether this was a formal *RNR*-1 or a informal *RNR*-1 dinner party . E_S
33017:31	Well , um , I think 0 it would probably depend on whether this was a formal *RNR*-1 or a informal *RNR*-1 dinner party . E_S
33027:12	but you know , \[ I , \+ I \] would n't have *-1 to worry about *-2 satisfying my guest . E_S
33031:32	But if it was a formal dinner party I would probably think of something else like , uh , N_S
33031:35	But if it was a formal dinner party I would probably think of something else like , uh , N_S
33038:12	so , I think on the lines of , N_S
33044:45	and *-1 being in Texas we do n't have too many , you know , people \[ that , \+ that *T*-2 \] eat crawfish E_S
33086:19	but , um , you know , if you have nails or anything you can plan on those being shot . E_S
33090:8	I think 0 for a dinner party N_S
33091:28	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't know E_S
33101:10	you know , we 'd just have crawfish and beer or something E_S
33102:49	but , um , if it was more formal like if I was , you know , working environment then I would probably , um , \[ sh- , \+ shell \] 'em or at least disconnect them from the head . E_S
33102:68	but , um , if it was more formal like if I was , you know , working environment then I would probably , um , \[ sh- , \+ shell \] 'em or at least disconnect them from the head . E_S
33117:18	But um I do n't know E_S
33120:68	And usually you use those like for frying or 0 *-1 to put *T*-2 in salads or to um You know make a sauce with *T*-2 or something like that E_S
33144:13	but um I think that N_S
33145:81	And also * to get totally off the subject of crawfish lots of vegetables and hors d'oeuvres and stuff like that for a dinner party I think that that really helps E_S
33165:57	And before I had my second child we sort of had a contest *ICH*-1 going where you know he would cook and then the next time it would be my turn and I 'd try *-2 to outdo him *T*-4 and then he 'd try *-3 to outdo me *T*-4 E_S
33184:34	\[ that \+ that \] got pretty competitive you know as far as who *T*-1 could come up with the best recipe E_S
33207:31	Uh it was a lot of fun you know E_S
33208:21	it something unique you know E_S
33209:32	and then we got into different um themes you know um whether it would be ethnic food Or um sometimes it would be um oh Oh I do n't know maybe an outdoor theme or uh elegant theme or you know N_S
33209:94	and then we got into different um themes you know um whether it would be ethnic food Or um sometimes it would be um oh Oh I do n't know maybe an outdoor theme or uh elegant theme or you know N_S

33215:11	Sometimes it might be the candlelight E_S
33216:13	and sometimes it might be the picnic out back or something E_S
33222:27	Well \[ that 's \+ you know that 's \] fun E_S
33227:90	\[ and \+ and \] we threatened *-1 to make the other two uh make us dinner one time Uh Just *-3 to even it out since we seemed *-2 to be unfairly doing all the cooking and they were doing all the enjoying E_S
33241:15	except that * knowing them they would probably do something ridiculous and terrible \[ just \+ just \] *-1 to uh make * sure that they did n't have *-2 to do it again E_S

33295:13	I do n't know what she calls them *T*-1 in E_S

33303:13	I do n't know E_S
33308:13	I do n't know if we have enough time for it E_S
33341:51	when you use corn starch \[ in \+ in \] gravy *T*-1 like you know when you have um Chinese food *T*-2 That kind of a gravy or a sauce that *T*-3 comes with a lot of that
33365:4	probably you have *-1 to heat it up for a good oh N_S

33387:8	I think 0 I 'm going *-1 to have *-2 to keep that in mind for my future because I hope *-3 \[ to have \+ to have \] lots of dinner parties Cause I like *-4 to N_S

33424:65	Right now I 'm taking a class on ettiquesy E_S and all the little bitty things that I did n't even know *T*-1 E_S

33431:22	I mean I thought for sure 0 I 'd been raised *-1 properly E_S
33434:35	but I 've been doing a lot of things *ICH*-2 wrong 0 I did n't know about *T*-1 E_S

33439:24	Well \[ I \+ I \] think 0 we 've covered the subject E_S
33454:11	I 'm sure 0 my husband will be surprised , 'cause we were talking about them the other day \[ mm- \+ \] before E_S
33469:59	That 's what the nurses kept *-2 saying *T*-1 as they laughed all the way , you know , down the hallway . E_S
33546:8	I know . E_S
33555:29	Instead of * having that level , you know they had a chrome strip that *T*-1 was n't level , E_S
33571:8	I know . E_S
33581:19	and he said , I think 0 you better call an orthopedist . E_S
33594:17	but I 'm not so sure that , N_S
33601:50	but \[ \[ I 've never , \+ I 'd , \] \+ you know , I was \] pretty much in shape * walking E_S
33602:28	\[ and , \+ and , \] you know , this is one of those things , E_S
33607:10	You know , I was real embarrassed , E_S
33614:42	I mean , I guess 0 I 'm glad , you know , that , um , nobody really noticed , E_S I guess 0 you could say 0 *T*-1 . E_S
33621:11	I 'm sure . E_S
33645:50	actually I was up on a ladder , and , uh , fell off . Leaned the wrong way . E_S
33678:13	I do n't know . E_S
33686:11	That 's probably the safer way E_S
33687:73	because I notice 0 in aerobics a lot of the women that *T*-1 do n't look like they should n't be doing certain things E_S
33702:14	and , you know , I 'm not heavy , E_S
33711:28	I mean , and I just do n't think 0 it 's healthy E_S
33718:17	and , I do n't know , E_S
33727:25	And at first after it happened I thought , maybe that 's a handicap access , E_S
33727:31	And at first after it happened I thought , maybe that 's a handicap access , E_S
33765:35	And it 's real funny because if you , you know , N_S
33766:8	it seems like when you exercise and expend the energy *T*-1 that you 'd be tired , E_S
33782:8	I know . E_S
33798:23	I 'm not heavy , you know , E_S
33799:5	maybe ten to fifteen pounds like any other human being . E_S
33807:17	And then , you know , you see these little girls in these little bitty things , E_S
33825:14	but , you know , sometime when I ask *T*-1 , I just feel like , boy , am I stupid or what . E_S
33835:18	\[ I do n't think 0 I 've ever , \+ I think 0 I 've , \] N_S

33846:13	I do n't know if the Dallas location , N_S
33847:11	it just seems that , N_S
33867:8	I thought 0 maybe one of these days I 'll drive over there and check it out . E_S
33867:15	I thought 0 maybe one of these days I 'll drive over there and check it out . E_S
33886:34	oh great , I have purple tights on , you know . E_S
33893:50	But \[ he , \+ he \] kind of said something *ICH*-1 to me about probably not as bad as your foot , E_S
33894:25	but he just said to me , maybe you ought *-1 to try bicycling E_S
33898:8	you probably will *?* for a while , because it 's going *-1 to be real tender . E_S
33904:17	Not anything , you know . E_S
33911:20	I could n't , you know adjust that . E_S
33913:8	I know what you mean *T*-1 . E_S
33915:8	You know more about this stuff than I do , obviously then , N_S
33954:18	Well , I do n't know . E_S
33962:18	Uh , the ammunition is probably so old 0 I 'm afraid *-1 to use it . E_S
33966:13	Well , I think , uh , 0 down here in Texas they do n't have a waiting period on handguns . E_S
33970:12	And , I think 0 they need that . E_S
33977:14	An- , you know , I do like *-1 to have my guns . E_S
33980:18	Uh , I do n't know if I 'll ever use it , you know . E_S
33980:47	Uh , I do n't know if I 'll ever use it , you know . E_S
33981:34	And like you , my bullets to my little pistol 's probably , uh , about three years old . E_S
33989:10	And I thought 0 that was really good . E_S
33990:10	And I think 0 if they , uh , N_S
34002:19	But , a- , you know , N_S
34010:8	I think , you know , 0 one of the things \[ \[ that , \+ that , \] \+ that \] *T*-1 needs *-2 to happen is , uh , * \[ to , \+ to \] stop the impulse buyer from , uh , *-3 buying it quickly \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , maybe putting a week 's waiting period or something on it . E_S

34019:8	I know E_S
34037:82	Because \[ if , \+ if \] you 're going *-1 to go *-2 buy something , uh , uh , of that nature , I think 0 \[ you , \+ you 're \] going *-3 to have some idea as to what you 're going *-4 to do *T*-5 with it . E_S
34039:20	In other words , you know , you do n't have a need * to go *-1 buy a gun *-3 to go *-2 shoot it the next day . E_S
34043:44	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ at times I \] think 0 they ought *-1 to have a waiting period on all firearms . E_S
34054:15	But I do n't know , uh , E_S
34055:8	I think 0 you could recover from a pistol but not from a shotgun . E_S
34063:23	Uh , it 's , you know , N_S
34091:8	I think 0 it was a three fifty-seven . E_S
34092:13	I 'm not sure . E_S
34125:15	It , you know , N_S
34130:19	Uh , but , you know , they used speed and accuracy and all that . E_S
34132:8	I think \[ that , \+ that \] the gun clubs serve a useful purpose . E_S
34133:142	In fact , I 'd like *-1 to see 0 somehow they tie the legislation into not only when you buy a weapon *T*-2 you have * to , uh , show that you 've gone to school or gone to some class * to know how * to handle that weapon *T*-3 . N_S
34136:14	I 've never thought of that . E_S
34141:14	And , you know , \[ it , \+ it , \] N_S
34142:39	even after you wait your nine days , if you do n't know how * to handle it *T*-1 , it 's just like * putting someone *ICH*-4 in an automobile that *T*-2 does n't know how * to drive *T*-3 . E_S
34142:111	even after you wait your nine days , if you do n't know how * to handle it *T*-1 , it 's just like * putting someone *ICH*-4 in an automobile that *T*-2 does n't know how * to drive *T*-3 . E_S
34162:50	He broke his leg and collar bone and a couple of other things I 'm sure , *-1 being , Mister Cowboy . E_S
34178:10	Do you believe 0 there ought *-1 to be legislation guiding the , uh , buyer and the seller ? E_S
34179:26	\[ And , \+ or \] do you believe that you ought *-1 to be able *-1 to sell your system , uh , because you own it ? E_S
34184:17	But , uh , I think 0 there ought *-1 to be some rule against it . E_S
34185:23	I 'll , uh , you know , N_S
34199:27	and I 've kept it , you know , the one gun that *T*-1 was in my name . E_S
34212:22	and , uh , I do n't know why I never registered it *T*-1 E_S
34215:13	I do n't think 0 you have *-1 to register a shotgun . E_S
34217:28	Um , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] voluntary . E_S
34243:73	And if you try *-1 to do anything , uh , like , uh , *-3 not identify yourself to the government , they know who you are *T*-2 . E_S
34251:28	\[ bu- , \+ bu- , \] you know , they know so , how much money *ICH*-2 you make *T*-1 a week to , uh , probably your , uh , N_S

34254:28	Uh , I 've lost my train of thought . E_S
34258:75	\[ You , \+ you \] were talking about , uh , uh , \[ Fed- , \+ what *ICH*-2 the Federal \] government knows *T*-1 about people . E_S
34264:23	\[ They , \+ they \] probably know everything from *ICH*-2 , half the time \[ \[ wh- , \+ ho- , \] \+ what \] time you go to the bathroom *T*-1 . E_S

34270:13	But they could know anything and everything about you . E_S
34277:55	And , uh , we 're wanting *-2 to get a couple of more that no one knows about *T*-1 . E_S
34290:13	Just you know , put up the money . E_S
34303:39	Uh , you go and \[ ever- , \+ \] you know , always see guns in there .
34326:10	You know . And I 'm sure 0 it 'd be even less for somebody with a good gun . E_S
34326:23	You know . And I 'm sure 0 it 'd be even less for somebody with a good gun . E_S
34329:10	And I think 0 the Federal government \[ is , \+ uh , is \] really far away from , uh , uh , control . E_S
34330:28	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't believe in , uh , N_S
34331:35	\[ I 'm s- , \+ I should n't \] probably say control . E_S

34349:13	I do n't know . E_S
34377:63	But \[ I was a lot , \+ I was a lot \] more impressed with her than I thought 0 I would be *?* . E_S
34392:18	it 's , you know , has n't worked out that way yet . E_S
34396:10	You know , \[ it 's , \+ uh , it \] looks good , you know if you like thrillers , anyway . E_S
34396:55	You know , \[ it 's , \+ uh , it \] looks good , you know if you like thrillers , anyway . E_S
34437:21	I mean , I 'm sure 0 I 'm going *-1 to be seeing it because in a week to Amarillo where my sister lives *T*-2 ,
34442:13	So I 'm sure 0 I 'm going *-1 to see the next one here real soon . E_S
34452:10	You know , it was n't impressive necessarily , E_S
34461:8	You know what I mean *T*-1 . E_S
34465:41	She goes to almost all movies *ICH*-1 with us except , you know , R rated . E_S
34467:31	but it was on a higher level , you know , where there were some things that kids did n't understand *T*-1 that adults did *T*-2 *T*-3 , E_S
34471:8	I think 0 that 's important
34472:41	if \[ \[ \[ you 're going , \+ you know , if you 're going , \] \+ uh , kids are going *-1 to , \] \+ uh , parents are going \] *-2 to have *-3 to go you ought *-4 to make it at least \[ semi- , \+ you know , semi \] for them too . E_S
34472:175	if \[ \[ \[ you 're going , \+ you know , if you 're going , \] \+ uh , kids are going *-1 to , \] \+ uh , parents are going \] *-2 to have *-3 to go you ought *-4 to make it at least \[ semi- , \+ you know , semi \] for them too . E_S
34495:68	I 's about *-1 to say , you 're not going *-2 to take her to that one , I 'm sure 0 *T*-3 . E_S
34512:15	and I ca n't think of which one it was *T*-1 . E_S
34520:14	I said that wrong , E_S
34526:20	There were , N_S you know ,
34527:23	he 's supposed , N_S you know ,
34537:8	I think 0 he did an excellent job in *-1 not being too much of a cop . E_S
34543:34	And I was so impressed with that because , you know , usually , N_S
34551:73	because , I mean , everybody grows up *-1 looking at these cop movies and trying *-2 \[ to , \+ you know , to \] imitate them or whatever . E_S
34555:17	And , uh , I thought 0 he did such an excellent job of * not going that far . E_S
34560:46	But at the beginning of the movie and all through the middle part , you know , he was \[ trying * to , \+ trying *-1 to \] get it , E_S
34569:25	and I guess 0 that I thought 0 *T*-2 was a real good acting and writing job both *ICH*-1 , you know , \[ because I think , \+ \] or directing job . E_S
34569:67	and I guess 0 that I thought 0 *T*-2 was a real good acting and writing job both *ICH*-1 , you know , \[ because I think , \+ \] or directing job . E_S
34569:83	and I guess 0 that I thought 0 *T*-2 was a real good acting and writing job both *ICH*-1 , you know , \[ because I think , \+ \] or directing job . E_S
34570:8	I think 0 they did a real good job of that . E_S
34574:19	And James Woods , I think 0 *-2 is who it was *T*-1 , did an excellent job as the cop . E_S
34575:20	I mean , you know , he just , N_S
34585:42	Probably the last comedy 0 we saw *T*-1 , now that I think about it , is HOME ALONE . E_S
34600:8	I thought 0 that would be one of those that I would love *-1 to watch *T*-2 over and over . E_S
34605:5	maybe it 's just the idea of my reaction to the first time .
34615:7	And maybe I just laughed so hard *ICH*-1 the first time that I did n't have it , E_S
34620:13	I do n't know E_S
34624:5	maybe so . E_S
34680:10	You know , but that 's at least the good thing about the Texas organization letting you buy the tickets cheaper . E_S
34682:18	But normally we do n't think about it until , N_S
34690:8	I know , because we *ICH*-2 can go *-1 spend fifteen dollars *-3 just getting in the three of us . E_S
34706:10	You know popcorn is not that expensive . E_S
34713:74	And , \[ it , \+ it 's \] just the idea that \[ these , \+ uh , these \] actors , you know , live in such lavish style . E_S
34789:15	now that I think back on it , I 'd say yeah , I ca n't believe that either . E_S
34789:52	now that I think back on it , I 'd say yeah , I ca n't believe that either . E_S
34791:8	You know what I mean *T*-1 , you know . E_S
34791:32	You know what I mean *T*-1 , you know . E_S
34798:14	That was a mistake that they made *T*-1 . E_S
34806:24	so \[ I , \+ you know , I \] can see that . E_S
34812:8	You think 0 my daughter would like it ? E_S
34834:10	and I know 0 they 're fake . E_S
34845:10	And I think 0 it 's an excellent movie for , N_S
34846:36	\[ if , \+ if \] she enjoys movies I think 0 *T*-1 it 'll work pretty good . E_S
34861:8	I may have *-1 to see the video . E_S
34867:16	I had n't even thought of that . E_S
34878:29	And that way you can watch it at your leisure . E_S
34882:12	there are certain things 0 you ca n't do *T*-1 with a video E_S
34886:19	and the idea that they may put a little extra in it I think 0 *T*-1 is a good idea . E_S
34886:43	and the idea that they may put a little extra in it I think 0 *T*-1 is a good idea . E_S
34896:44	and so the idea of * getting a little extra with it I think 0 *T*-1 is a good idea . Because \[ they , \+ they \] make bundles of money off those things . E_S
34898:8	I know it . E_S
34909:28	we keep *-1 holding out , you know . E_S
34912:34	I 'm getting to the point where , you know , \[ I watch , \+ well I watch \] NICK AT NIGHT *T*-1 . E_S
34918:7	So probably everything 0 I going *-1 to say *T*-2 is kind of dated . E_S
34945:8	I think 0 when you 're in college *T*-1 \[ you kind of , \+ \] you have more of a regular schedule in terms of , you can watch every week . E_S
34982:8	I know , E_S
34988:20	and we 'll , you know , look at what you want *-1 to see *T*-2 . E_S
34992:8	I believe that . E_S
34994:14	So , you know , it was prime time , E_S
35002:48	and the stuff that *T*-1 was on the prime , the networks , you know , A B C , N B C , C B S , was , N_S
35007:10	you know , I mean , it was n't even funny E_S
35018:8	I know exactly how you feel *T*-1 . E_S
35020:8	You know what I 'm saying *T*-1 . E_S
35028:47	Nothing surprised me any more * seeing it on the T V , you know . E_S
35054:10	you know , you watch some of the cartoons , E_S
35060:18	none of it 's probably damaging , lot of times . E_S
35065:26	and that was about it , you know . E_S
35070:24	But now , in order *-1 to seem , you know , humane and normal , we do allow them to watch cartoons and stuff . E_S
35070:34	But now , in order *-1 to seem , you know , humane and normal , we do allow them to watch cartoons and stuff . E_S
35075:37	But it 's , just one of those things , you know , E_S
35081:80	I do n't understand why , first of all , the public puts up with it *T*-1 . Second of all , why the networks think that , you know , we enjoy that kind of stuff *T*-2 . E_S
35081:93	I do n't understand why , first of all , the public puts up with it *T*-1 . Second of all , why the networks think that , you know , we enjoy that kind of stuff *T*-2 . E_S
35085:25	It *EXP*-1 's hard * to believe that nobody can be any more creative than that . E_S
35090:18	It must be the marketing pressures , E_S
35091:14	and , you know , their demographic studies that they do *T*-2 that *T*-1 show , you know , that everybody 's I Q has dropped dramatically or something . E_S
35091:59	and , you know , their demographic studies that they do *T*-2 that *T*-1 show , you know , that everybody 's I Q has dropped dramatically or something . E_S
35102:8	I know . E_S
35104:10	You know , why do you do this to yourself *T*-1 ? E_S
35110:8	I know , E_S
35111:21	I 'm trying *-1 to think if there 's anything 0 I do *T*-2 , E_S
35121:27	As a matter of fact , you know when I was a kid *T*-1 , * excuse me , my parents used *-2 to have , N_S
35129:21	the children 's program I think 0 *T*-3 at the time was called *-2 WHAT *T*-1 'S NEW . E_S
35149:47	If half of the time was n't spent *-1 * watching commercials , it probably would n't be so bad . E_S
35169:52	I 'll sit down for the big games , the Super Bowl , and the championship you know , things like that . E_S
35178:10	and I know how everybody 's doing *T*-1 , E_S
35194:23	and then you 're , you know , trying *-1 to pass the time *-2 to wait until the next comedian comes up . E_S
35197:8	You know what I did *T*-1 . E_S
35214:13	I do n't know , E_S
35227:32	In fact , \[ it 's , \+ I think 0 it 's \] on tonight . E_S
35238:32	and I consider that fairly intelligent humor . You know . E_S
35256:20	Oh , that makes me think , E_S
35270:10	you know , \[ it was , \+ it was \] just automatic , too , E_S
35272:8	I think 0 it 's come around again . E_S
35299:10	You know , if you keep that same format . E_S There 's only so long that you can be outrageous *T*-1 . E_S
35303:17	\[ that 's for sure , \+
35304:14	that is for sure . \] E_S
35372:17	and it *EXP*-3 just seems *-1 to make sense to me *-2 to get the most car for your money * to get something like that . E_S
35376:59	In fact my dad recently got \[ a , \+ um , a \] Pontiac , uh , * believe *RNR*-1 six thousand E_S
35396:13	And so I think 0 he got a real good deal . E_S
35401:26	So \[ it 's , \+ I think 0 it 's \] a pretty good option . E_S
35404:8	I think so too . E_S
35415:36	Well \[ now , \+ uh , now , \] they may be the demonstrator models that the sales reps drive around in *T*-1 . E_S
35426:21	He says 0 it 'll probably be gone in a done , E_S
35427:13	and it 's probably gone by now . E_S
35447:23	That 's what I 'm thinking about *T*-1 on my next car is do I want *-2 to get another brand new car because last two cars are brand new E_S
35451:40	or do I look for a used car that *T*-1 's maybe \[ two , \+ three \] years old \[ that \+ but that *T*-2 's , \] you know , low mileage and in good shape . E_S
35451:95	or do I look for a used car that *T*-1 's maybe \[ two , \+ three \] years old \[ that \+ but that *T*-2 's , \] you know , low mileage and in good shape . E_S
35457:26	\[ or \+ , or \] is something wrong with it E_S
35467:20	I mean , you know , if you 're going *-1 to look at fifty different cars you do n't want *-2 to do this E_S
35471:146	but if you 've narrowed it down to one or two you can have the car , uh , uh , checked *-1 at , uh , an independent service station and have them go through it from top to bottom and tell you if they can find anything wrong , because they do n't have any financial interest in it . E_S
35485:10	do you know ? E_S
35487:16	Oh , I 'm thinking around twenty or twenty-five dollars . E_S
35497:30	\[ I would , \+ I would \] think so . E_S
35500:11	I would think so . E_S
35510:23	I do n't want *-1 to think about *-2 buying a car for a while . E_S
35511:89	I just want *-1 to enjoy *-2 not having any car payments for a while and enjoy *-2 watching my savings account get larger and , uh , you know , hang on to the one 0 I 've got *T*-3 for a few years because \[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's , \] \+ it 's \] almost four years old , E_S
35525:29	I just about could *?* really because I think 0 my car , N_S
35536:26	\[ I , \+ I \] would think 0 that 's true . E_S
35554:54	and I do want *-1 to hold onto it \[ and , \+ and \] you know , enjoy it while it 's not having any mechanical problems whatsoever , E_S
35577:39	Because one of these days I 'll be getting a six seater probably too . E_S
35621:31	If I just keep the oil in , it seems *-1 to be okay . E_S
35622:14	But , you know , that 's a sign that I 'm going *-1 to have *-2 to do something sooner or later . E_S
35651:11	That 's probably the best thing . E_S
35655:7	Or maybe more than that , as I 've learned . E_S
35668:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 * trading it in , they just use that as additional , N_S
35669:8	they may give you supposedly a better deal on your new car 0 you 're buying *T*-1 , E_S
35674:12	What I think *T*-1 . E_S
35677:8	I think 0 you 're right . E_S
35684:10	and I think , 0 maybe , as you get outside the Dallas area , E_S
35684:19	and I think , 0 maybe , as you get outside the Dallas area , E_S
35687:10	Well , maybe because it 's outside of Dallas they are giving a little bit better prices , E_S
35703:47	and what you could expect *T*-1 *ICH*-2 , they said *T*-3 , you know , a five percent over cost and then options at cost and everything . E_S
35754:7	and sure enough I saw that guy , E_S
35761:13	and I 'm sure 0 he probably knew what *T*-1 was going on the very next day E_S
35761:23	and I 'm sure 0 he probably knew what *T*-1 was going on the very next day E_S
35775:13	So I 'm sure 0 he knew . E_S
35807:27	but , uh , Uh , I do n't know if it 's their proposal or one that *T*-1 's being seriously kicked *-2 around . E_S
35812:68	\[ I 've , \+ I 've \] always felt for a long time that \[ I , \+ I \] think that all young kids ought *-1 to do a stint , uh , primarily in the military . E_S
35819:20	\[ they \+ you know , they \] have , uh , it mandatory \[ for , \+ for \] \[ \[ the , \+ the \] \+ uh at least the \] young men , E_S
35827:13	I do n't know about the young women , E_S
35828:13	I do n't know if they have *-1 to serve in the military , too . E_S
35840:13	I do n't think 0 it 's a bad idea , E_S
35868:42	and he did n't have a chance *-1 to , uh , you know , N_S
35881:10	You know , I had wanderlust , you know . E_S
35881:31	You know , I had wanderlust , you know . E_S
35908:13	I do n't know . E_S
35909:59	There 's other kinds of service to the country that *T*-1 could be done *-2 , you know , E_S
35921:219	I mean , I 've always felt that people on welfare should be required *-1 to spend \[ at least part of their time , \+ not all the time because that takes away from their opportunity * to look for a job , but at least some of their time \] \[ * to look for , \+ *-2 to go out \] and clean up the roads . You know , E_S
35941:4	sure . E_S
35964:10	You know , these guys go down there and get their unemployment checks , E_S
35969:45	They get all this stuff together and sit down and have poker games you know , E_S
35975:29	What I hear *T*-1 one time , I think 0 it was on Paul Harvey 's , uh , radio segment , that he said that if the money that *T*-2 goes into welfare each year was *-3 to be given *-4 directly to the people without all the middle people in the government bureaucracy , each person would receive like forty-five thousand dollars *T*-5 . E_S
35983:8	I know . E_S
35984:40	\[ \[ \[ I , \+ you , \] \+ you think about , \] \+ you think about \] the layer of bureaucracy between the money and the recipient , E_S

36106:107	and you see , you know , fourteen year old kids flaunting money , because the parents give them money 0 * to go down and play video games all night *T*-1 , you know E_S
36108:8	I know . E_S
36112:8	I know . E_S
36117:15	Well , you know , you know 0 why they do it *T*-1 is so they can get them out of the house . E_S
36117:23	Well , you know , you know 0 why they do it *T*-1 is so they can get them out of the house . E_S
36129:28	One of the other subjects is do you think 0 the public school systems are in trouble ? E_S
36137:14	and , you know , when I 's in graduate school *-1 working on my master 's degree in math *T*-2 , I was , uh , teaching as \[ part of my , \+ part of the \] program . E_S
36139:32	\[ That was a lot , \+ that 's probably the most \] fun 0 I had *T*-1 . E_S

36156:55	I mean , \[ that , \+ that 's \] a sad thing 0 * to think *T*-1 , E_S
36161:37	but you have *-1 to look out for yourself you know , E_S
36169:11	That 's wrong . E_S
36189:10	You know , we need , N_S
36198:4	sure . E_S
36200:14	But , you know , when it gets right down to it *T*-1 , N_S
36216:10	You know , \[ \[ it 's just , \+ it 's , \] \+ it 's \] ridiculous the way 0 unions have gone *T*-1 . E_S
36242:23	And it 's like , you know . N_S
36258:20	I mean , you know , we 've never caught up , E_S
36259:15	and I do n't think 0 we ever will *?* . E_S
36269:10	You know . And they only did it because \[ they , \+ I guess they \] were embarrassed that they 're so good at it . E_S
36280:8	I think 0 youngsters ought *-1 to go out and do some public service , E_S
36305:8	I think 0 they ought *-1 to take them and , I do n't know , just have sort of like \[ \[ a , \+ a , \] \+ a \] manpower pool and say Okay , look , E_S we need somebody ... E_S
36305:49	I think 0 they ought *-1 to take them and , I do n't know , just have sort of like \[ \[ a , \+ a , \] \+ a \] manpower pool and say Okay , look , E_S we need somebody ... E_S
36343:25	and so , at the time , walking seems *-1 to be the best . E_S
36349:41	and I enjoy that because I like the group association , you know , like *-1 exercising with other people . E_S
36419:8	I think 0 you really have *-1 to be disciplined . E_S
36424:10	and I think 0 you really have *-1 to *?* , at least twice a week , just *-3 to maintain the shape that you 're in *T*-2 . E_S
36427:18	With the walking , I think 0 they said 0 *T*-2 you need *-1 to walk at least twelve miles a week for it to be aerobically beneficial . E_S
36448:10	You know , I usually do it because I want *-1 to , because I know 0 it 's good for me , not because ,
36448:54	You know , I usually do it because I want *-1 to , because I know 0 it 's good for me , not because ,
36476:15	So , it would seem *-1 to be real beneficial . E_S
36480:20	\[ Maybe it , \+ maybe it \] speeded up the process and all that . E_S
36482:11	Well I think 0 it made parts of it a lot easier . E_S
36488:21	well , then I do n't know how much you 've been through *T*-1 it , E_S
36489:10	but I think 0 parts of it made a lot easier . E_S
36500:28	but it 's not as bad as I thought 0 it would be *?* , E_S
36501:10	and I think 0 the exercise helped . E_S
36516:8	I think , 0 that 's what the class that *T*-1 meets on Saturday mornings . E_S
36524:8	I know a lot of people that *T*-1 talk about exercise and say , Well , I do n't want *-2 to exercise ,
36535:13	I 'm not sure how long we 've been talking *T*-1 E_S

36637:18	Um , I do n't know , E_S
36641:24	and another thing is 0 the thing seems *-1 to get , N_S
36642:19	it 's dirty you know , E_S
36647:13	I do n't know E_S
36664:13	I do n't know how you can really keep , uh , the inside of a tent clean *T*-1 . E_S
36667:13	I do n't know . E_S
36669:18	Other than , you know , * taking your shoes off right before you walk in or something \[ and , \+ and \] sweeping it out everyday , it *EXP*-1 's really hard * \[ to , \+ to \] keep the sand and dirt out of it . E_S
36672:129	well , what \[ \[ we were doing *T*-2 , \+ we were just going *-1 to say , \] \+ we 're just going *-3 to sleep \] in the tent and hang out at night , so , you know ,
36685:105	Um , did you have another , a big tent , \[ \[ like \+ uh , um , like a , \] \+ 0 *T*-1 looks like a \] sitting area type , you know , like a two room type MUMBLEx ? E_S

36696:8	I know that I said , that 's , N_S
36703:21	just some of them are known E_S
36719:43	because , uh , we were having a really big problem up here in certain areas , E_S
36739:54	\[ They , \+ uh , they \] must , uh , work on that , you know , E_S

36782:17	so , I do n't think 0 camping , N_S
36783:5	maybe in the backyard , E_S
36784:35	but I do n't see *-1 going on a camping trip probably until next summer . E_S
36803:13	I do n't know E_S
36826:42	But when you get inside *T*-1 they 're really nice , you know , E_S
36884:28	I mean \[ some , \+ I think 0 some \] people that *T*-1 had fairly sturdy , um , vehicles or whatever if they had like a Winnebago or something and they were farther in away from the water , I think 0 they stayed . E_S
36884:132	I mean \[ some , \+ I think 0 some \] people that *T*-1 had fairly sturdy , um , vehicles or whatever if they had like a Winnebago or something and they were farther in away from the water , I think 0 they stayed . E_S
36891:8	I know 0 \[ I always \+ I \] like MUMBLEx *-1 to get right on the water , E_S
36900:66	like I say , they 're \[ kind of , \+ just kind of \] more sturdy than anything , you know , E_S
36923:8	I think 0 they are more of a threat to their own people at this day and time . E_S
36929:13	Um , I think 0 their biggest problem is just , you know , * obtaining food 0 * to live *T*-1 , E_S
36929:40	Um , I think 0 their biggest problem is just , you know , * obtaining food 0 * to live *T*-1 , E_S

36939:8	I believe 0 Communism is very much waning . E_S
36943:53	If they can get the army , or the military to sway to their side , I think that , uh , *T*-1 it will be on the way out eventually . E_S
36954:127	Well , \[ I do , \+ I do \] realize that , uh , uh , the Bush Administration is n't too happy \[ with , \+ with \] how they 're handling their internal , uh , strife *T*-2 , you know , as far as diplomacy is concerned *-1 . E_S

36961:76	I think 0 Gorbachev realizes that he 's got \[ a , \+ a \] major uh , uh , power figure , you know , competing against him , E_S
36962:10	and I think 0 it 's going *-1 to be pretty close to his demise if he does n't follow suit with Yeltsin as far as , uh , * realizing , N_S
36963:29	well , he does realize it , you know , with the fact that \[ they reduced the \+ uh , or they , increased the \] prices on their \[ food , \+ food \] and goods . E_S
36969:8	I think that it went up a thousand percent on most , N_S
36985:15	but I do n't know how convinced *ICH*-1 the people are *T*-2 of him yet , myself . E_S
36992:14	So , you know , they 'll go with , you know , whoever *T*-1 comes through for them . E_S
36992:38	So , you know , they 'll go with , you know , whoever *T*-1 comes through for them . E_S
36998:10	and I think 0 he 's got between the Old Guard \[ and , \+ , and \] the new , uh , glasnost . E_S
36999:13	Uh , I think 0 it 's kind of escalated to a point where it 's out of control *T*-1 . E_S
37003:10	And I think 0 he had *-1 to pull in the reins the only way 0 he knew how *T*-2 , in order *-3 to keep the \[ peace on , \+ peace on \] both sides . E_S
37004:10	So I think 0 that 's \[ where \+ you know , , kind of where \] he 's stuck *-1 *T*-2 . E_S
37004:39	So I think 0 that 's \[ where \+ you know , , kind of where \] he 's stuck *-1 *T*-2 . E_S
37005:8	You know what I 'm saying *T*-1 ? E_S
37011:12	and you know , he 's a tough guy , E_S
37014:33	I mean , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 overall he 's been \[ a , \+ a \] , good figure for the Soviet Union . E_S
37015:18	I mean , I think 0 his intentions and his ideals \[ are , \+ are \] uh , well intentioned . E_S
37020:13	but I just think that because of the basic needs that the people do n't have *T*-1 , N_S
37021:8	I think 0 that , uh , makes the problem most severe , and makes him \[ look , \+ look \] worse that \[ what his , \+ um , what his \] ideals are *T*-1 , personally . E_S
37028:13	\[ I think 0 it 's , \+ I think 0 it 's \] a lot of , uh , oh , how do you put it *T*-1 ? , bureaucracy \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , one thing , and then all the corruption . E_S

37510:8	I think 0 the Royals will do okay . E_S
37515:8	I think 0 he won Cy \[ year , \+ uh , two *RNR*-1 out of three *RNR*-1 years , \] E_S

37869:14	And , you know , it 's going *-1 to really hurt \[ the , \+ the \] middle class , uh , people , I think 0 *T*-4 . Because , uh , they 're the ones that *T*-2 will probably have *-3 \[ to , \+ to \] carry the brunt of the load . E_S

37909:34	and you want *-1 to encourage them , you know , \[ to , \+ to \] be active and everything in school , E_S

37933:100	\[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 what you have *-1 to do *T*-2 is * just , uh , keep \[ in , \+ \] uh , you know , *-3 encouraging them \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , uh , try *-3 to be open with them , so that \[ y- , \+ you \] can deal with the problems as they come up . E_S
37940:110	\[ You got * to , \+ you got *-1 to \] be your child 's best friend , I guess 0 *T*-3 , even when they 're a teenager and they , you know are kind of standoffish *T*-2 , E_S

37957:28	but , it just is amazing , you know , E_S
37968:107	And the A C L U is going *-1 to get after them and have a lawsuit . Which *T*-2 is going *-3 to take twenty years 0 * to resolve *T*-4 , you know . E_S

37978:10	You know \[ that 's where they , \+ that 's where they \] get \[ the , \+ the \] deep rooted values *T*-1 E_S
38015:18	Um , I do n't know , E_S
38030:39	It 's basically just data entry and * running , you know , \[ some , \+ some \] software E_S
38031:45	so it does n't really have *-1 to be anything sophisticated , you know . E_S
38107:16	I did n't even know 0 they had anything like that . E_S
38121:26	MUMBLEx in for a while , you know , N_S
38122:83	\[ he had a , \+ he had , \] uh , one of those , what are they *T*-1 , top secret things , you know , where he could n't talk about what he did *T*-2 *T*-3 ,

38304:8	I know those two . E_S
38311:8	You probably use MUMBLEx or something like that , for your , uh , data entry stuff that you 're , talking about *T*-1 . E_S

38433:39	but I do n't know who they are *T*-1 , you know . E_S
38437:20	A lot of them just know me by name and phone voice . E_S
38444:11	you just know them by the telephone , E_S
38447:8	I think 0 we 've MUMBLEx got the subject . E_S
38481:22	I read quite a bit , probably do n't read as much as I would like *-1 to *?* . E_S
38506:24	Uh , THE ROAD LESS TRAVELLED was probably one of my favorites . E_S
38527:13	Well , um probably the best one that \[ I , \+ I \] know of *T*-1 and I work with *T*-1 all the time is called *-2 SEARCH FOR SIGNIFICANCE by Robert McGee E_S
38527:48	Well , um probably the best one that \[ I , \+ I \] know of *T*-1 and I work with *T*-1 all the time is called *-2 SEARCH FOR SIGNIFICANCE by Robert McGee E_S
38535:11	It 's probably one 0 you 'd find *T*-1 in like a Christian book store . E_S
38536:13	I do n't know what the chains are *T*-1 down there .
38545:10	Um , probably * should stay on the topic , E_S
38571:16	Oh , I 'm sure , E_S
38572:11	I 'm sure . E_S
38585:14	that 's for sure .
38603:10	But I thought 0 it was real interesting . E_S
38610:13	but I never seem *-1 to have the time 0 *-2 to do that kind of reading *T*-3 . E_S
38612:8	I know . E_S
38616:23	Um , I trying *-1 to think of some of my other favorite books , E_S
38633:21	I was trying *-1 to think of , N_S
38635:23	but I was trying *-1 to think ,
38641:28	that 's the one 0 I was thinking of *T*-1 . E_S
38647:42	and it 's kind of the whole concept of global peace , you know , like , and \[ communities \+ * building communities . \] E_S
38656:57	And he did , uh , mention Beginning Experience Weekends as \[ one of the , \+ you know , one of the \] places . E_S
38670:13	I ca n't think of his name . E_S
38686:13	I ca n't think of what his name is *T*-1 \[ right , \+ right \] off the bat , though . E_S
38712:27	It 's just , I was just thinking ,
38718:17	and , I do n't know when I 'm going *-1 to get to them all *T*-2 . E_S
38726:13	I do n't think so . E_S
38731:13	I do n't think so . E_S
38733:31	So , well , I 'm trying *-1 to think of what other kind . E_S
38741:20	Um . Trying *-1 to think . E_S
38750:8	I think 0 the last novel \[ 0 I read *T*-2 \+ I read *T*-1 , \] I guess , in conjunction with my wife over vacation last year . E_S
38765:10	You know , \[ it 's , \+ it *EXP*-2 's \] so easy * to get caught *-1 up on * reading just for your work , or , you know , self improvement , E_S
38765:101	You know , \[ it 's , \+ it *EXP*-2 's \] so easy * to get caught *-1 up on * reading just for your work , or , you know , self improvement , E_S
38777:8	I think so , too . E_S
38813:21	I was trying *-1 to think of some \[ while , \+ while \] it was , uh , talking about it , E_S
38823:24	I 'd say 0 reading is probably one of my biggest ones , because it 's the type of thing that \[ you can , \+ you can \] do *T*-1 a little bit at a time , whereas ,
38829:37	and , uh , I would have *-1 to , you know , put stuff away . E_S
38870:33	Mostly just stuff that I can , you know , use *T*-1 right around the house or give *T*-1 away as gifts . E_S
38914:17	and , uh , I thought , Oh , I can do this while I watch T V . E_S
38921:49	\[ It 's , \+ it is \] a lot more difficult than it seems like it would be *?* . E_S
38924:13	But I was wrong . E_S
38936:23	and it was about fifteen by twenty maybe . E_S
38943:10	and I thought I better *T*-1 do some simple things and work up to this because it *EXP*-3 was just so difficult * to get it done *-2 . E_S
38951:71	\[ and , \+ and , \] it was just too much 0 * to begin with *T*-1 . E_S And I think kind of discouraged me from *-2 doing much more with it . E_S
38968:21	I 'm trying *-1 to think of anything else 0 I do *T*-2 as a hobby .
39013:66	I 've got a few planters out there that \[ I , \+ I 'll , \] uh , you know , N_S
39021:15	I kept *-2 thinking that it was going *-1 to get cold one more time , E_S
39022:10	but I think 0 we 're probably past that now . E_S
39022:23	but I think 0 we 're probably past that now . E_S
39023:8	I probably should go *-1 buy some . E_S
39027:33	I guess 0 if I had a house I might enjoy gardening , some . E_S
39045:17	but I 'm not really knowledgeable . E_S
39048:10	You know , I feel like , Oh , I 've accomplished something . E_S
39057:13	I do n't know too much about it either . E_S
39062:32	but I do n't always get direct sun except in certain spots . E_S
39066:16	And so that 's probably my problem there . E_S
39084:29	And \[ I 'd , \+ I \] think 0 when I was real little *T*-1 I probably had a finger in on that every time 0 he did it *T*-2 and had *-3 to be out there and watch and that type of stuff . E_S
39084:58	And \[ I 'd , \+ I \] think 0 when I was real little *T*-1 I probably had a finger in on that every time 0 he did it *T*-2 and had *-3 to be out there and watch and that type of stuff . E_S
39095:12	So . I think 0 it *EXP*-1 would be nice * to just go out and pick some tomatoes off the porch . E_S
39102:17	So , um , I think 0 if I just would be , N_S if I 'd do something , be motivated enough *-1 to do something , I think it would work out well . E_S
39102:92	So , um , I think 0 if I just would be , N_S if I 'd do something , be motivated enough *-1 to do something , I think it would work out well . E_S
39110:13	I do n't know if you 'd call that a hobby , E_S
39128:10	So I thought , this 'll \[ help , \+ you know , help \] them shed , E_S
39128:39	So I thought , this 'll \[ help , \+ you know , help \] them shed , E_S
39131:7	and sure enough , boy the fur just came off like crazy once I got them in the tub . E_S
39150:10	and we thought , well maybe when they 're a little bit bigger *T*-1 then we 'll , N_S
39150:19	and we thought , well maybe when they 're a little bit bigger *T*-1 then we 'll , N_S
39167:54	but since I 'm in an apartment , \[ I just , \+ I \] do n't think 0 an apartment is big enough for a dog . E_S
39174:13	But I just think 0 dogs \[ need , \+ need \] *-1 to be outside , though . E_S
39179:93	if we were going *-1 to get anything now it would definitely be a cat , or even a bird or a fish tank or \[ something , \+ you know . Something \] small E_S
39190:54	because , you kind of , N_S \[ even , \+ even \] a cat , you never know when they might bite or scratch or something *T*-1 . E_S
39190:65	because , you kind of , N_S \[ even , \+ even \] a cat , you never know when they might bite or scratch or something *T*-1 . E_S
39194:39	They 're not as likely *-2 to *?* as a dog might *?* , I guess 0 *T*-1 . E_S
39197:63	Especially when they 're not quite to the age of * understanding that they 're hurting , you know , E_S that N_S
39202:37	And if I was a cat or dog , I 'd respond probably by *-1 biting or something . E_S
39203:13	I do n't know . E_S
39208:17	But , Well , I think 0 we probably reached our time limit . E_S
39208:27	But , Well , I think 0 we probably reached our time limit . E_S
39214:4	probably E_S
39258:28	Uh , well for a dinner party , I think 0 *T*-1 one of my favorite things is baked chicken and white wine . E_S
39283:50	And , um , the cafeteria is real good about * putting out recipes , you know ,
39305:30	And , uh , I 'm trying *-1 to think what else . E_S
39356:40	Well , \[ I just , \+ I just \] do n't think 0 you can go wrong with something like that . E_S
39356:56	Well , \[ I just , \+ I just \] do n't think 0 you can go wrong with something like that . E_S
39397:13	\[ I know , \+ I know \] what you mean *T*-1 . E_S
39397:24	\[ I know , \+ I know \] what you mean *T*-1 . E_S
39434:52	depending on the fruit 0 you use *T*-1 \[ it 's , \+ you know , it 's \] real colorful . E_S
39475:54	and \[ that 's some- , \+ that 's something \] that just , you know , \[ it *EXP*-1 \+ \] does n't take a long time * to fix *T*-2 , E_S
39499:26	* mix up a little , uh , mayonnaise with some dijon mustard , and honey until it just , N_S
39546:31	I 'm going *-1 to have *-2 to think of that . E_S
39557:8	I think 0 we 'll try *-1 to do something a little bit , N_S
39558:8	we might try *-1 \[ \[ to , \+ to , \] \+ um , to \] grill some flounder or salmon steaks . E_S
39612:25	That 's what I was just thinking *T*-1 , E_S
39636:11	I 'll might have *-1 to visit the State Book Store . E_S
39671:13	I do n't think 0 it would *?* . E_S
39673:10	You know , we do n't have that much of it now . E_S
39727:48	And we have a share alike column in the paper , where people , you know , write in and share recipes or write in and say I 'm looking for this recipe *T*-1 , E_S
39757:66	* Just mix the canned beans *ICH*-1 together , and brown sugar and molasses and bake them in catsup , you know , E_S
39776:128	So , \[ I , \+ I \] try *-1 to always keep my eyes open \[ and \+ \] because a lot of time you can \[ find , \+ find \] really good recipes where you would n't even think about it *T*-2 . E_S
39813:10	You know , that 's true . E_S
39814:13	I do n't think 0 I 've ever seen them nationally on basketball . E_S
39858:34	Um , as far as college teams , uh , I know 0 it 's really easy * to say *-1 , E_S
39860:106	\[ so , \+ uh , so , \] I finally am feeling better about myself as far as college teams . Although , \[ I 've , \+ I 've \] really , you know , N_S
39883:58	And , uh , I was very pleased with all three games , because Kansas , uh , N_S you know ,
39892:78	U N L V kind of gave me the impression of * being \[ a , \+ uh , uh , oh , I do n't know , a \] macho team , you know , E_S
39892:100	U N L V kind of gave me the impression of * being \[ a , \+ uh , uh , oh , I do n't know , a \] macho team , you know , E_S
39893:21	\[ they just did n't seem , \+ they seemed \] *-1 to think 0 they were better than everybody else E_S
39893:32	\[ they just did n't seem , \+ they seemed \] *-1 to think 0 they were better than everybody else E_S
39893:45	\[ they just did n't seem , \+ they seemed \] *-1 to think 0 they were better than everybody else E_S
39894:21	\[ and , \+ and \] maybe they were *?* , E_S
39909:13	I do n't know , E_S
39910:24	it looked like U N L V may have had more , uh , talent , E_S
39914:67	but , as far as * playing together as a team that day , \[ it did n't , \+ \] Duke seemed *-1 to have them off balance . E_S
39935:41	They shut all that down and made them play half court it seemed 0 *T*-1 E_S
39941:16	see I do n't know if they were necessarily behind , E_S
39946:19	Uh , and , you know , that meant that they had *-1 to play a second half E_S
39962:13	\[ I think , \+ I think 0 \] \[ that , \+ that \] probably was the difference in that game . E_S
39962:24	\[ I think , \+ I think 0 \] \[ that , \+ that \] probably was the difference in that game . E_S
39962:52	\[ I think , \+ I think 0 \] \[ that , \+ that \] probably was the difference in that game . E_S
39966:63	Because it really could have gone \[ an- , \+ either \] way . Down to the end , you know . E_S
39968:26	So do I take it that you think though that the Lakers \[ will , \+ uh , will \] win E_S
39974:13	I do n't know . E_S
39988:15	but I do n't think 0 he 's really been a super star for them . E_S
40007:8	I think 0 Magic does a , N_S
40009:24	They 'll make it , you know , N_S
40016:8	That sure is *?* . E_S
40021:8	I think 0 that 's going *-1 to be one of those \[ that *T*-4 's , \+ uh , that *T*-2 's \] won *-3 by the home team , you know , E_S
40021:106	I think 0 that 's going *-1 to be one of those \[ that *T*-4 's , \+ uh , that *T*-2 's \] won *-3 by the home team , you know , E_S
40025:48	whoever *T*-1 has home court advantage is going *-2 to win that one I think 0 *T*-3 . E_S
40027:20	One of those two will probably be , um , in there , E_S
40034:17	So , I do n't know , E_S
40043:17	So , uh , that might help them . E_S
40069:38	and then the next time \[ he 'll , \+ you know , he ca n't \] seem *-1 to hit the side of a barn . E_S
40069:54	and then the next time \[ he 'll , \+ you know , he ca n't \] seem *-1 to hit the side of a barn . E_S
40073:17	So , I do n't know , E_S
40077:56	\[ \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm kind of , \] \+ I 'm \] not sure about him this year . E_S
40084:38	He 's , starting *-1 to be more consistent , you know , \[ right \+ at the right \] time of the year . E_S
40090:32	Oh , any dark horses I , uh , you know , N_S
40094:82	\[ San Antonio , \+ San Antonio \] is the dark horse that *T*-1 \[ could , \+ could \] really flip in there , I think 0 *T*-2 . E_S
40106:36	He 's got *-1 to be pretty much , you know , N_S
40107:48	I use *-1 to say 0 Akimo Lija was the dominant player , you know , when he , N_S
40117:54	and they kind of just scoot out of his way or take a step back , you know , E_S
40139:13	Well , I thought 0 he was gone period . E_S
40145:13	Well , that might have been what it was *T*-1 , E_S
40148:58	but \[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 the headlines said something about him , you know , that the Mavericks released him or something , E_S
40149:17	\[ I , \+ maybe I \] misunderstood what they meant *T*-1 . E_S
40155:8	They may have done it . E_S
40157:11	you never know . E_S
40166:41	That 's what he was being paid *-2 *T*-1 , you know , E_S
40173:19	That 's what I think *T*-1 . E_S
40225:13	I do n't think 0 there 's any clear pick , you know . E_S
40225:40	I do n't think 0 there 's any clear pick , you know . E_S
40233:25	They are two guys that *T*-1 seem *-2 to find a way when they , N_S
40237:32	When it 's on the line *T*-1 , they seem *-2 to find a way . You know , E_S
40237:57	When it 's on the line *T*-1 , they seem *-2 to find a way . You know , E_S
40308:48	I 'm kind of had \[ different , \+ different \] ideas from what probably the majority of people have *T*-1 , E_S
40318:13	I do n't know , E_S
40349:10	You know , how can you help *-1 depending on the day care center *T*-2 , you know , E_S
40349:56	You know , how can you help *-1 depending on the day care center *T*-2 , you know , E_S
40354:85	have you ever noticed 0 they 're always like a family owned center where the mother and the daughter and the son run it *T*-1 , you know , kind of thing . E_S
40373:53	I was just going *-1 to ask you \[ how it , \+ you know , if \] you liked \[ the , \+ the , \] N_S
40375:30	or you would n't have him there , I know 0 *T*-1 , E_S
40391:12	But , I thought okay , I 'm going *-1 to keep an open mind here , E_S
40444:63	that 's what I wanted *-1 to *?* *T*-2 , because \[ I , \+ uh , you know I \] just could n't wait *-3 to have kids E_S
40445:110	and so , if I was , N_S I was so anxious *-2 to have them E_S and I could n't wait *-1 to have them it *EXP*-4 would be kind of silly , you know , *-3 to go back to work as soon as I had them , E_S
40465:30	so \[ it was n't , \+ you know , she was n't \] an infant . E_S
40485:8	I know how that goes *T*-1 . E_S
40493:126	and , uh , when school lets out *T*-1 , \[ \[ I just do n't , \+ I have n't , \] \+ I have \] no idea what I 'm going *-2 to do *T*-3 , because I certainly ca n't afford what we did *T*-4 last year which *T*-5 was , N_S
40513:33	and there we had , uh , I do n't know some , N_S
40532:8	I think 0 I can leave them home , E_S
40536:37	if I can work part of the day , you know , I 'm going *-1 to leave them home . E_S
40548:72	in fact I 'm doing that right now with their afternoons , when they get home before I do *T*-1 . You know , E_S
40570:38	But , I was n't embarrassed * to shop around you know , E_S
40587:43	and all these people are registered *-1 with their association E_S and , you know , go like
40601:50	she gets home visitations by the \[ s- , \+ \] MUMBLEx I do n't know , the state boards , I guess , some of them and then some by the association , E_S
40609:32	and she says this is it , E_S you know ,
40630:14	and , you know , I think 0 they were fine , E_S
40630:22	and , you know , I think 0 they were fine , E_S
40644:57	and then there would be a whole ton of other kids , all in the same room , you know , E_S
40648:8	you know what fun they had *T*-1 with these computer games E_S
40665:14	or , you know . N_S
40679:63	So , another thing that we tried *-1 to do *T*-2 , N_S \[ I , \+ I \] know 0 your son 's too young right now , E_S but \[ we 're trying , \+ we tried \] *-1 to sign him up for after school scouts and , stuff like that E_S
40686:8	I think 0 that 's really important , E_S
40690:31	and we 've already started about , N_S you know ,
40695:10	You know , I mean , I just , N_S you know ,
40695:40	You know , I mean , I just , N_S you know ,
40696:12	we both think of \[ that \+ that \] as just so important , *-1 to get him involved in stuff like that E_S
40715:10	you know , and , you know , we did the Easter egg hunts ,
40715:24	you know , and , you know , we did the Easter egg hunts ,
40723:14	and to \[ know what we wan- , \+ know what he was \] doing *T*-1 you know , and enjoy it , N_S
40723:34	and to \[ know what we wan- , \+ know what he was \] doing *T*-1 you know , and enjoy it , N_S
40723:62	and to \[ know what we wan- , \+ know what he was \] doing *T*-1 you know , and enjoy it , N_S
40734:20	and Lord , I could n't believe it . E_S
40743:10	and I thought , I 'm going *-1 to end up on this elephant with him , you know , . E_S
40743:59	and I thought , I 'm going *-1 to end up on this elephant with him , you know , . E_S
40750:72	so stuff like that *ICH*-3 is starting *-1 to come along where it 's really , getting fun *T*-2 , you know . N_S
40761:40	and he like comes home with something new everyday , you know E_S
40762:20	and so , \[ I know , \+ I know \] 0 they 're working with him E_S
40762:31	and so , \[ I know , \+ I know \] 0 they 're working with him E_S
40772:27	and he goes *-1 running , you know , E_S
40777:14	so , you know . Yeah , E_S
40787:82	whenever you say Bright Steps *T*-1 , everybody goes , oh , I 've heard 0 that 's the best day care in town , you know , E_S
40800:68	and she had *-1 to open the second one up in Lewisville because , her waiting list was just like , you know , like a year old , E_S
40815:8	She knows something right , that she MUMBLEx N_S
40818:8	She knows what she 's doing *T*-1 , E_S
40830:10	And I think 0 that really makes a difference . E_S
40834:102	They 're in it because it 's a profession , not because it 's a job 0 they could get *T*-1 because they did n't qualify for anything else , you know . E_S
40841:44	And , his old day care as much as I loved it , you know , N_S
40847:70	but the people that she got *T*-1 were there because they were n't qualified *-2 to do anything else you know . E_S
40865:21	that 's great , you know . E_S
40868:20	but then sometimes , you know , N_S
40890:42	\[ but , \+ but \] \[ it 's , \+ you know , it 's \] like where he was *T*-1 before I was only paying sixty three , E_S
40901:21	\[ and , \+ you know , and \] there were places that *T*-1 were cheaper , E_S
40909:10	you know , your peace of mind is worth a little bit of money , you know , E_S
40909:54	you know , your peace of mind is worth a little bit of money , you know , E_S
40933:18	I said , you know , it does n't matter if for whatever re- , N_S
40968:14	and , you know , it went through like , N_S
40969:72	and it showed \[ who my , \+ uh , well , who my \] husband 's parents were *T*-1 , you know . And , who he married *T*-2 and then how many children we had *T*-3 and then like his brothers and sisters E_S
40982:40	But \[ it , \+ it \] really did , E_S you know ,
41004:30	And , it told like , uh , you know , where the first Connallys came over *T*-1 , E_S
41042:32	I said , this ca n't be , you know , E_S
41046:41	because a lot of them lived in like a group , you know , down one highway . E_S
41056:40	And , so , we were going down , the highway , you know , E_S
41064:17	and I kept *-1 thinking , this guy is putting me on . E_S
41067:26	Nobody has this many relatives , you know . E_S
41075:124	And , another thing that *T*-1 's really good about , uh , family reunions , is * having everybody just cook whatever *T*-3 is their specialty , and bring it . \[ At , \+ \] because nobody it seemed \[ like *T*-4 , \+ liked \] the same thing . E_S
41096:22	Where if you said a certain thing and say , okay , we 're all going *-1 to have fried fish , or , we 're all going , *-2 to have fried chicken . E_S
41103:8	Everybody might not like that . E_S
41134:40	And , they had a church service ahead of it , E_S you know ,
41155:13	I do n't think 0 my family is as big as your husband 's . E_S
41156:13	I do n't think 0 we 'd need a whole church , E_S
41162:20	I mean , you know , there would be one person who *T*-1 lived there that *T*-2 would have a house , E_S
41164:22	So \[ it , \+ I think 0 it \] would get kind of expensive . E_S
41166:12	But , you know what you can do *T*-1 ? E_S
41176:17	and it , you know , like on a lake , E_S
41181:20	I mean , you know , it 's got little rooms that *T*-1 separate off of it and stuff , E_S
41206:44	And , then it has little rooms off of it where , you know , you 'd go and sleep at night time *T*-1 . E_S
41220:63	And then , every time 0 you wanted *-1 to go *-2 eat with somebody *T*-3 , you 'd probably have *-4 to go to out , *-5 eat or something . E_S
41226:20	that was , N_S you know ,
41238:36	* Ask them what they have *T*-1 , you know , at area lakes and all . If they have something like that E_S
41245:153	because now every time 0 we plan anything *T*-1 , just about , we write to the Chamber of Commerce of where we 're going *T*-2 because , you can find out so much easier *ICH*-3 , that way , than * try *-4 to locate it , you know , E_S
41260:40	I mean , you ca n't get it exact , you know , usually , E_S
41274:52	and three or four or five families can stay in those cabins because they have , you know , just the single bunk beds and stuff . E_S
41279:17	And then , you know , you can have cookouts and stuff like that E_S
41288:35	But , \[ that 's , \+ uh , you know , that 's \] the best way 0 I found *T*-1 , because whenever you have , something where you go and , N_S
41308:17	But , I did n't think 0 that was as good . Because , it was like , you know , you could n't really talk and stuff , like you could *?* when , you were at the lake , or somewhere , you know , where you were out . E_S
41308:59	But , I did n't think 0 that was as good . Because , it was like , you know , you could n't really talk and stuff , like you could *?* when , you were at the lake , or somewhere , you know , where you were out . E_S
41308:137	But , I did n't think 0 that was as good . Because , it was like , you know , you could n't really talk and stuff , like you could *?* when , you were at the lake , or somewhere , you know , where you were out . E_S
41341:114	\[ What they did *T*-1 was , \+ Well , see what they did *T*-2 was , \] okay , \[ they , \+ uh , they \] wrote to all the initial people , you know , \[ the , \+ the \] oldest ones . E_S
41356:8	I think 0 there was four or five different people , that *T*-1 would call , you know , some of them , if they did n't have their addresses and all on them , E_S
41356:57	I think 0 there was four or five different people , that *T*-1 would call , you know , some of them , if they did n't have their addresses and all on them , E_S
41363:14	and , you know , they told them that what we had *-1 to do *T*-2 was when we sent back in our information *T*-3 , we had *-4 to tell them how many people *T*-5 were going *-6 to be coming , you know . E_S
41363:144	and , you know , they told them that what we had *-1 to do *T*-2 was when we sent back in our information *T*-3 , we had *-4 to tell them how many people *T*-5 were going *-6 to be coming , you know . E_S
41370:104	And then , \[ when they , \+ when they \] talked to us *T*-1 or when they sent us the letter *T*-2 , \[ it , \+ \] uh , you know , * to get the information and all , it asked , you know , will you be willing *-3 to bring E_S
41370:145	And then , \[ when they , \+ when they \] talked to us *T*-1 or when they sent us the letter *T*-2 , \[ it , \+ \] uh , you know , * to get the information and all , it asked , you know , will you be willing *-3 to bring E_S
41394:53	Now if there was a sickness or something like that , I mean , you know , you 're not going *-1 to lose that many . E_S
41410:14	and , you know , \[ there , \+ I mean , there 's , \] N_S
41411:13	I do n't know . E_S
41441:65	it *EXP*-2 was up to me , \[ who I was going *-1 to , \+ \] you know , whether I wanted my kids and , you know , \[ my , \+ any of my \] family to come . E_S
41441:95	it *EXP*-2 was up to me , \[ who I was going *-1 to , \+ \] you know , whether I wanted my kids and , you know , \[ my , \+ any of my \] family to come . E_S
41457:17	And then , you know , it never did , N_S
41479:23	and they charged us , I think 0 \[ it was \+ like , it was like \] *RNR*-3 five or six dollars , I ca n't remember exactly , you know , that we paid *T*-2 for the book to be printed *-1 . E_S
41479:100	and they charged us , I think 0 \[ it was \+ like , it was like \] *RNR*-3 five or six dollars , I ca n't remember exactly , you know , that we paid *T*-2 for the book to be printed *-1 . E_S
41490:47	it 's just \[ a , \+ oh , like a , \] you know , folder type thing . E_S
41494:27	But it has the entire , N_S you know ,
41501:8	I know ,
41505:48	and , it will be something 0 my kids will have *T*-1 , you know . E_S
41508:14	I was just thinking of \[ that . \+ What \] you could tell your kids *T*-1 . E_S
41513:19	Because if you stop and think , N_S
41514:13	I do n't know if you 're like me , E_S
41515:10	but I know very little about before my grandparents . E_S
41523:20	the thing is 0 I know a lot of stories , E_S
41527:30	but \[ I ca n't , \+ you know , I remember \] these stories E_S
41533:32	I could n't tell my kids what , you know , those people were like *T*-1 , E_S
41535:15	but I do n't know who it was *T*-1 . E_S
41541:81	but then usually when you find out some information from like your parents *T*-1 , then \[ you can find out from , \+ you know , you can find somebody \] else that *T*-2 can tell you something else about these , E_S
41567:8	I know 0 many people are \[ co- , \+ very comfortable \] in the classroom and what have *T*-1 you *-2 wearing pants . E_S
41579:31	It 's pretty lax about , um , you know , N_S
41599:17	and then , you know , obviously when I 'm doing anything that I 'm in front of people *T*-2 , \[ or , \+ or \] making presentations , teaching , whatever *T*-3 . I 'm going *-1 to dress up more . E_S
41604:10	And I think 0 that does make a difference , E_S
41605:58	because when you do have *-1 to be in front of people *T*-2 , uh , I think 0 *T*-3 \[ you , \+ \] \[ the , \+ the \] tendency there is * to wear dresses and suits \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , more classical style of clothing . E_S
41621:26	\[ just because it 's , \+ maybe it 's just because \] of the sexist views and everything E_S
41623:13	I do n't know , E_S
41644:28	and then there are some that *T*-1 may be will come like four inches or five inches above the knee . E_S
41666:19	Uh , even though I may have them from sixth grade on up through , uh , grandmothers , in my class . E_S
41674:8	because maybe \[ they , \+ those \] are not the clothes that *T*-1 are the most , uh , appealing to you , or the most , uh , complimentary to you . E_S
41685:44	Well I feel like too , on the job , when , you know , there 's men around and some of the managers are men *T*-1 , \[ you just , \+ you know , you \] do n't want them looking at your legs necessarily . E_S
41685:110	Well I feel like too , on the job , when , you know , there 's men around and some of the managers are men *T*-1 , \[ you just , \+ you know , you \] do n't want them looking at your legs necessarily . E_S
41698:8	again maybe because I was at the school , there were still many teachers who *T*-2 wore mini skirts , E_S
41712:15	And so , I think , uh , uh , of course , now I go the other extreme , 0 I do not like *-1 to see , in the corporate areas , uh , all the women dressed *-2 like men , with the suits and , uh , white shirts and ties and what have *T*-3 you so that they all look exactly the same . E_S
41721:8	I think 0 there should be individuality in dressing . E_S
41728:14	Not , you know , N_S
41736:39	\[ Well , I , \+ \] and I \] do n't think that you have *-1 to be manish and extremely tailored *-2 \[ to , \+ to \] look professional . E_S
41741:8	I think that \[ you , \+ you \] make of that what you wish *T*-1 E_S
41775:48	And , so , uh , uh , I just feel that , uh , you know each person has *-1 to dress to their own liking and for their own comfort . E_S
41779:21	But , uh , there are certain norms that companies should be able * to , uh , put *T*-1 out as guidelines for their employees . E_S
41783:30	and \[ they do n't , \+ you know , your boss does n't \] come up to you and say now * remember , tomorrow you have a meeting
41787:113	I mean , \[ they , \+ they \] leave it up to you and your judgment * \[ to , \+ to \] use good judgment and dress tastefully and dress for whatever occasion you may have *T*-1 . E_S
41802:64	And they do n't allow , uh , \[ any sweat , \+ any sweat \] shirts or t shirts that *T*-1 might have vulgar , or , you know , anything like that on it , E_S
41802:85	And they do n't allow , uh , \[ any sweat , \+ any sweat \] shirts or t shirts that *T*-1 might have vulgar , or , you know , anything like that on it , E_S
41808:10	and I think 0 that 's good because it does allow people to be individual E_S
41813:14	Or , you know , if you want *-1 to be comfortable and casual you can *?* , E_S
41814:13	and sometimes I think 0 you may be more productive if you 're comfortable with what you 're wearing *T*-1 and can \[ \[ be , \+ be , \] \+ feel \] more relaxed .
41814:23	and sometimes I think 0 you may be more productive if you 're comfortable with what you 're wearing *T*-1 and can \[ \[ be , \+ be , \] \+ feel \] more relaxed .
41815:82	Whereas , uh , sometimes when you 're in the suit and feel , kind of almost stiff and \[ you 're not , \+ you know , maybe you \[ do n't , \+ uh , ca n't \] \] get as comfortable *-2 to sit down *T*-1 E_S
41815:87	Whereas , uh , sometimes when you 're in the suit and feel , kind of almost stiff and \[ you 're not , \+ you know , maybe you \[ do n't , \+ uh , ca n't \] \] get as comfortable *-2 to sit down *T*-1 E_S
41819:14	and , you know , like when I 'm writing training material *T*-1 , I prefer *-2 to be more comfortable unless I know 0 I have *-3 to meet with a customer later during the day . E_S
41819:74	and , you know , like when I 'm writing training material *T*-1 , I prefer *-2 to be more comfortable unless I know 0 I have *-3 to meet with a customer later during the day . E_S
41824:26	So , \[ that 's \+ I think , 0 that is \] good that they 're like that . E_S
41825:11	I do know 0 there 's a lot of companies that *T*-1 are very strict about what the employees wear *T*-2 E_S
41826:46	and they must wear blue or gray or black and a white shirt and , you know , no variation , E_S
41851:29	\[ And , \+ uh , and \] I think 0 that 's sad because that does n't allow for any individuality . E_S
41863:24	I guess 0 we 've talked probably long enough . E_S
41881:10	and I believe also in \[ shooting of , uh , rape , \+ I mean * killing a rape \] victim . I mean someone in the process of rape , E_S
41885:20	and \[ I do n't know what el- , \+ I do n't really remember what else . \] E_S
41891:51	\[ How do yo- , \+ \[ wh- , \+ what \] do you \] think *T*-1 about it . E_S
41893:8	I think 0 it 's justified . E_S
41900:54	\[ I agree , \+ \[ I , \+ I , \] agree , \] you know , E_S
41903:8	I think 0 it should be *?* in other cases other than just * shooting a policeman . E_S
41909:18	I mean , I think 0 they 're doing their duty , E_S
41910:10	but I think 0 if they 're going *-1 to come out and kill somebody else then they deserve it . E_S
41920:34	they were talking about , uh , oh , I know what it was *T*-1 , E_S
41923:58	\[ tha- , \+ it 's \] like a call in survey that *T*-1 says , you know , do you think so E_S
41923:69	\[ tha- , \+ it 's \] like a call in survey that *T*-1 says , you know , do you think so E_S
41930:116	And one of \[ the things , \+ the questions \] the other day , this last paper , and I have n't seen the results of it , I 'm anxious *-1 to *?* , was do you think that , um , capital punishment ought *-3 to apply to drug dealers .

41932:11	Oh I think , N_S

41960:18	You know , I think 0 that 's what it 's going *-1 to take *T*-2 , though . E_S
41962:8	I think so , E_S
41963:8	I think , N_S
41967:36	it 's going *-1 to take , uh , you know , N_S
41968:20	the police , \[ I think , \+ I do n't think \] 0 *-1 \[ can do it , \+ can do it \] alone , you know . E_S

41971:8	I think 0 you 're right . E_S
41979:42	It 's going *-1 to take all of us , you know getting together and just saying , we are not going *-2 to take it any more . E_S
42001:8	I think 0 they said 0 forty-one *ICH*-2 had been shot *-1 out of one church in the last year . E_S
42004:52	The only thing about the death penalty \[ \[ and , \+ and \] \+ \] I know \[ that , \+ that \] they try *-1 to be careful E_S
42005:23	and they try *-1 to be sure E_S
42006:41	but these people are on death row for like twenty years , you know . E_S
42009:8	I know it . E_S
42011:14	An- , you know N_S
42012:29	\[ if , \+ if , \] you know N_S

42015:48	to me you could not sentence them to death unless , the case was for sure . E_S
42025:11	they 're sure . E_S
42038:60	So once , they 've gotten the penalty and there is no doubt , * do it , you know , E_S
42043:52	\[ I don- , \+ I \] guess 0 , I mean \[ that may sound , \+ that sounds cold , \] E_S

42440:8	I think so . E_S
42444:8	I think 0 it would be worth it

42451:17	well what do you think *T*-1 ? E_S
42453:47	Well , \[ I 'm kind of leaning towards , \+ I do n't know , I 'm thinking about \] \[ what , \+ from one to ten what \] my no would be *T*-1 . E_S

42454:11	It would probably be somewhere closer to , uh , less control because I do n't see , N_S
42461:31	But , \[ \[ I guess \+ I believe , \] \+ I think \] 0 the N R A has gone overboard the wrong way . You know , E_S

42470:24	\[ and , \+ and \] I think 0 that 's a dumb , situation . E_S
42474:108	Because there has got *-1 to be some kind of background check * to see , that the people who *T*-2 are buying a gun are buying it for a useful purpose , you know ,
42486:55	If they 're can check your driver 's license every time you get a ticket , you know

42521:13	I do n't think 0 they 're going *-1 to go to a gun store or pawn shop and get it the right way when there 's a check *T*-2 , E_S

42525:21	\[ But , \+ but \] maybe we 'll prevent a few John Hinckleys . E_S

42545:26	\[ I , \+ I \] just think 0 it makes honest people more honest E_S

42615:146	I mean , there are a lot of kids who when they 're ten *T*-2 *T*-1 look like they 're twelve , or fourteen \[ or , \+ \[ and , \+ and , \] \] especially some of the minority children . Whether , you know a racist or not , E_S

42672:8	I think 0 they ought *-1 to do that with toy guns , E_S

42890:16	sometimes \[ I think , \+ I wonder \] if \[ I , \+ I 'm \] not about *-1 to load it because \[ I , \+ you know , I \] assume that the kids are not going *-2 to ever get up there , E_S

43126:24	and he does the , you know , edging and all that kind of thing , E_S
43128:54	and so we do n't really put a lot of money into the , uh , you know , like N_S
43129:13	this lawn could probably stand a couple of loads of dirt , and some Saint Augustine . E_S
43132:16	I do n't even know what it is *T*-1 out front , E_S

43160:8	I think 0 it comes in a forty-pound bag , E_S
43183:33	and we got rid *-1 of them , * believe it or not , with smoke bombs , which *T*-2 is just about impossible 0 * to do *T*-3 , E_S

44144:78	I just get sorry feelings for people that *T*-1 their family came from there and how they feel *T*-2 about , you know , our intervention and their government and stuff like that , E_S
44149:85	there 's so many people *ICH*-1 there \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-2 get the kind of control that *T*-3 's bad , you know , E_S

44179:46	even if a country chooses a government that *T*-1 's not , you know , exactly the kind of government that we have *T*-2 , you know \[ or , \+ or \] as in complete opposition to it , at least it 's their choice , \[ as long , \+ as long \] it 's one \[ that *T*-3 's , \+ \[ that , \+ that \] \] *T*-4 makes since , * so to speak , you know , E_S

44273:8	I think 0 people are just saying , no way , we do n't want anywhere of this . E_S
44276:8	I think , uh , 0 Central America has always been one of those places where people are more passive *T*-2 , you know , where it 's always the minority that *T*-1 \[ are , \+ are \] trying *-4 to make the country better *T*-3 . E_S

44303:10	You know , they are the ones \[ that *T*-1 set , \+ that *T*-2 set \] a lot of the rules E_S

44623:13	I do n't know , E_S

44843:20	Well , uh , do you believe 0 only fifty percent of the people actually vote ? E_S
44845:8	I think 0 it 's somewhere really close to that cause I think 0 a lot of people believe that their one little vote is not going *-1 to make that much difference . E_S

44845:61	I think 0 it 's somewhere really close to that cause I think 0 a lot of people believe that their one little vote is not going *-1 to make that much difference . E_S
44850:48	Because they feel like so many of the politicians are like crooked , you know ? E_S
44854:46	And so they figure why *-2 go out and vote *T*-1 , you know . E_S
44857:10	And I think 0 one of the good ways of * solving that is \[ to \+ like , everybody likes *-1 to come to \] a party so * have a voting party \[ and , \+ \] uh , you know , like in communities and have the issues there and then everybody go *-2 vote together and then maybe come back over and have brunch or something .

44861:110	I mean that 's the only , thing that I can figure *T*-2 out because I 've heard so many people say well I 'm not going on voting on that one , you know ,
44866:10	and I think 0 it does . E_S
44881:20	Uh , I , personally , think that we need *-1 to do more along the education lines in the schools and the children from the little ones on up , with the idea of \[ the , \+ the \] value of voting and the purpose of voting and that one vote does make a difference . E_S
44885:19	And \[ ma- , \+ maybe \] * let them have some mock , I mean uh , you know elections and stuff and vote for different people in their classes and start *-1 really young . E_S

44895:10	However , probably not enough of them , uh , country wide . E_S
44909:19	But , uh , I know \[ I , \+ I \] spent thirty-four years in education here in the Dayton area E_S
44916:14	And , you know , that was in fifty-one . E_S
44930:16	Well I do n't know how it is *T*-1 up there E_S
44935:21	I mean , I 'm sure 0 you heard about some of ours . E_S
44944:34	And that 's the reason 0 I said 0 maybe if you had something like a block party *T*-1 . E_S
44952:40	and then we 're going *-1 to go and vote , you know . E_S
44954:10	like , maybe they could give something
44955:69	like , uh , the top neighborhood , if you had a hundred percent in your neighborhood or something like that , you know . E_S
44956:125	I mean \[ it does n't have *-1 to be , \+ it could be \] like \[ a , \+ a \] sign that they would put *T*-2 down at the end of your block . You know , or anything like that E_S
44962:8	It seems like people just do n't care anymore . E_S
44963:45	They say , huh , well it do n't make any difference , you know . E_S
44972:17	And , uh , I know 0 my husband
44992:21	\[ and , \+ you know , but \] they did n't go *-1 vote . E_S
44996:18	And , uh , \[ maybe if they , \+ like you said , if they \] would start when little kids and start *-1 letting them vote and learn how * to vote and all *T*-3 . \[ Then , \+ uh , and \] the importance of it because , okay , if you do n't vote for your friend over here , well your friend 's not going *-2 to have a chance . E_S
45004:34	just like he needs everybody else 's , you know . E_S
45006:11	Because I know 0 here , uh , until you get into high school
45029:14	and , uh , certainly if the youngsters had that opportunity that , you know , \[ they , \+ they \] understood that the principles of the country were established *-1 so that everyone would have a say and everyone would have a vote and what that vote meant *T*-2 E_S
45029:44	and , uh , certainly if the youngsters had that opportunity that , you know , \[ they , \+ they \] understood that the principles of the country were established *-1 so that everyone would have a say and everyone would have a vote and what that vote meant *T*-2 E_S
45051:10	You know a good \[ i- , \+ idea \] for the young kids like that too , is * to have like \[ a \+ a \] mock one . E_S
45070:14	they would understand probably by the time 0 they were in high school *T*-1 , E_S
45077:10	And I think , you know , 0 that 's an excellent idea . E_S
45077:20	And I think , you know , 0 that 's an excellent idea . E_S
45078:125	They would put them *-4 to realize \[ that , \+ that \] they 're going *-1 to have *-2 to do what someone else says *T*-5 even though they did n't vote for it . And that maybe they need *-3 to think twice about *-6 voting . E_S
45078:141	They would put them *-4 to realize \[ that , \+ that \] they 're going *-1 to have *-2 to do what someone else says *T*-5 even though they did n't vote for it . And that maybe they need *-3 to think twice about *-6 voting . E_S
45090:20	Uh , and I do n't know that , uh , a lot of people vote in primaries for that very reason . E_S
45095:20	and , uh , I do think 0 more needs *-2 to be done *-3 along that line * to help * to , uh , teach the \[ people , \+ uh , uh , everyone , \] uh , more about what *T*-1 is going on with voting and with nonvoting . So that , uh , \[ we can make , \+ they 're making \] some more intelligent decisions . E_S
45101:8	I think 0 that sounds great . E_S
45103:10	you know , it 's going *-1 to take \[ the , \+ uh , a \] whole generation of my feeling , uh , before that 's going *-2 to be accomplished *-2 . E_S
45105:15	Well , you know , they 'd have *-1 to start when they 're real young *T*-2 . E_S
45109:20	I mean , you know , it would have *-1 to be a child that *T*-2 is just coming into school . E_S
45116:15	but I did not know how * to use those voting machines *T*-1 E_S
45122:8	They thought 0 that was funny . E_S
45123:21	Ah , she do n't even know how , wah , wah . E_S
45129:66	And \[ it took me , \+ I mean it *EXP*-3 took \] such courage 0 you would n't believe *T*-1 * to go *-4 vote the first time because I was waiting for somebody to laugh at me because I did n't know how * to work the machines *T*-2 . E_S
45129:140	And \[ it took me , \+ I mean it *EXP*-3 took \] such courage 0 you would n't believe *T*-1 * to go *-4 vote the first time because I was waiting for somebody to laugh at me because I did n't know how * to work the machines *T*-2 . E_S
45138:5	sure it is *?* . E_S
45146:22	And , uh , I did n't know how *-2 to work the machine , you know *T*-1 . E_S
45146:51	And , uh , I did n't know how *-2 to work the machine , you know *T*-1 . E_S
45147:37	And it really scared me , really bad . E_S Because I thought all these people are going *-1 to laugh at me because I do n't know how * to work this machine *T*-3 . E_S
45147:82	And it really scared me , really bad . E_S Because I thought all these people are going *-1 to laugh at me because I do n't know how * to work this machine *T*-3 . E_S
45148:85	Where \[ if they 'd , \+ if they 'd \] had a class or something or just \[ to \+ a short time , you know , * to , \] said okay , this is the way , N_S
45163:34	and she said well , uh , why , you know . E_S
45165:29	I said because I want him to know how * to use one of these *T*-2 E_S
45184:22	And , I mean , I think 0 that 's bad . E_S
45189:10	You know , here I was *T*-1 . E_S
45242:59	But , um , our Chows , we 've had them , I 'd say *RNR*-1 , right around six maybe seven years E_S
45259:17	Um , because we thought 0 they would socialize easier , E_S
45279:26	It 's telling , um , you know N_S
45289:20	And , uh , you would think , you know , that they were all dogs the way 0 she would prance around them \[ and , \+ and \] paw at their face *T*-1 E_S
45289:30	And , uh , you would think , you know , that they were all dogs the way 0 she would prance around them \[ and , \+ and \] paw at their face *T*-1 E_S
45293:16	now I do n't know \[ how , \+ how \] it would be *T*-1 * bringing in , uh , like cat to a \[ full , \+ full \] grown dog . E_S
45304:8	I think 0 they would socialize easier . E_S
45306:8	I think , so , too . E_S
45320:20	uh , E_S \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 a lot of \[ \[ that , \+ that , \] \+ that \] we hear *T*-1 all the time is how you bring them up *T*-2 . E_S

45330:18	I mean , you think 0 they 're lapdogs . You know , E_S
45330:41	I mean , you think 0 they 're lapdogs . You know , E_S
45345:53	so , it was kind of like , she had her babies and understood about , you know , N_S
45352:8	I think 0 that really helped \[ and , \+ \] um , my daughter , you know , \[ since , \+ since \] she 's little has been playing with them E_S
45352:55	I think 0 that really helped \[ and , \+ \] um , my daughter , you know , \[ since , \+ since \] she 's little has been playing with them E_S
45359:8	I think 0 it *EXP*-1 's good for kids to grow up around pets , \[ as , \+ as \] long as they do n't have any allergies to them or anything . E_S
45366:10	But I think 0 it really helps them to understand \[ when , \+ when \] they go to other people 's houses *T*-1 E_S
45368:33	I see so many times kids just , you know , N_S
45381:18	I mean , some maybe N_S
45383:77	and a lot of kids are scared of that . \[ And \+ \] which I understand *T*-1 because she is , you know , a lot of movement and everything E_S
45390:30	she would n't \[ hi- , \+ you know , harm \] them at all E_S
45392:17	so , \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 it *EXP*-1 's a good idea * to have them . E_S
45392:28	so , \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 it *EXP*-1 's a good idea * to have them . E_S
45413:34	Oh , a lot louder than a dog , you know , E_S
45414:46	a dog you can tell *T*-1 , * stop *-2 barking , you know , or whatever . E_S
45421:16	Well , we 've thought about *-1 getting an aquarium , \[ partly , be- , \+ partly \] for the cats , E_S
45425:8	I think 0 the cats would really enjoy it ,
45437:28	\[ we , \+ we 're , \] thinking about *-1 getting a saltwater , E_S
45447:58	and in your , MUMBLEx the luck of * keeping them alive , through those first , you know , few days . N_S
45458:8	I know 0 they are *?* . E_S
45466:10	you know , \[ I really do- , \+ I really do n't \] care much for them . E_S
45470:8	I think 0 the saltwater are a lot more attractive than , N_S
45471:13	I do n't know , E_S
45488:38	\[ but the- , \+ and they 're , \] you know , N_S
45495:10	You know , you ca n't roll around and tussle around with it like you can *?* a dog or a cat E_S
45499:79	\[ I would n't , \+ I would n't \] dare *-1 have \[ a , \+ a \] goldfish here because , it would probably be in a small bowl E_S
45521:30	MUMBLEx that 's just like kids , you know , E_S
45522:23	\[ yo- , \+ they \] know that they 're not supposed *-1 to do it , E_S
45523:39	but they 're going *-1 to do it anyway because they know 0 they 're not supposed *-2 to *?* . E_S
45548:16	but we never even thought that about when we got the dog *T*-1 E_S
45558:10	You know , and then the first weekend 0 we had him *T*-1 \[ we had , \+ we were \] \[ in a apartment , \+ in a two bedroom apartment , \] E_S
45599:72	\[ when , \+ when \] we had our family dog *-3 growing up *T*-2 I was eleven or twelve , I think 0 *T*-4 , when we first got him *T*-1 , E_S
45603:58	and I was n't really involved in \[ the , \+ the \] paper training , and , you know , * teaching him commands and stuff E_S
45628:27	and we finally got her , you know , house trained *-1 and everything ,
45630:40	If you do not pick the trash *ICH*-1 up , you know , the container , and put it on a table or chair or something , she 'll knock it over , E_S
45642:31	anything \[ that , \+ that \] they think 0 *T*-1 is good , E_S
45668:10	and she knows 0 it 's wrong , E_S
45668:23	and she knows 0 it 's wrong , E_S
45674:27	So , \[ you , \+ she \] knows 0 she does wrong . E_S
45674:40	So , \[ you , \+ she \] knows 0 she does wrong . E_S
45712:8	I think 0 they are *?* because they 're getting better every year . E_S
45722:13	I do n't think so . E_S
45764:15	But \[ I think 0 they 're going *-1 to , \+ I think 0 they 're really going *-2 to \] do good because it seems like they 're finally all coming together . E_S

45764:88	But \[ I think 0 they 're going *-1 to , \+ I think 0 they 're really going *-2 to \] do good because it seems like they 're finally all coming together . E_S
45772:34	\[ the , \+ the \] N F L draft really seems *-1 to be doing its job E_S
45773:63	because , * got teams \[ like , \+ like \] Buffalo who *T*-1 \[ were n't , \+ certainly were n't \] a powerhouse , uh , ten years ago . E_S
45780:10	so it seems *-1 to be , uh , moving around and , uh , \[ to , \+ to \] New Orleans ' benefit , E_S
45797:10	And I think 0 that hurt a lot of , you know , people even wanting *-1 to play on their team . E_S

45807:86	\[ Any t- , \+ any team \] \[ \[ that , \+ tha- , \] \+ where \] the owner would fire Tom Landry , you know , is like one of the greatest coaches of all time *T*-1 . N_S
45818:22	I mean , if you think about those years that we had the losing season *T*-1 , of how bad , N_S
45819:68	I mean his players were constantly getting kicked *-1 off the team because of drugs , because of , uh , you know , *-2 messing with young children E_S
45823:38	and , I mean , it was just one thing it seemed like *T*-1 right after the other , with them . E_S
45833:10	You know , he 'd , uh , never seem *-1 to be able *-2 to keep his guys healthy . E_S
45833:31	You know , he 'd , uh , never seem *-1 to be able *-2 to keep his guys healthy . E_S
45834:61	And then even like , uh , what is it *T*-1 , Eric Dickerson left , the team , you know , E_S
45840:10	You know , like people were jumping ship right and left . E_S
45844:17	And , I do n't know , E_S
45853:20	and he just , you know , N_S

45866:32	\[ tha- , \+ I mean , you know , that 's \] the way 0 I felt *T*-1 about it . E_S
45879:8	I know . E_S
45882:34	Well , They , had quite a few quarterbacks if you think about it . Uh , E_S
45884:21	See , I ca n't even think of who the New Orleans quarterback , is *T*-1 . E_S
45891:23	Uh , \[ I ca n't think of the , \+ I ca n't think of his \] name now , E_S
45891:45	Uh , \[ I ca n't think of the , \+ I ca n't think of his \] name now , E_S
45908:13	I do n't know E_S
45909:14	because , you know , they gave away a lot of their drafts . For different people for , you know , other places . E_S
45909:63	because , you know , they gave away a lot of their drafts . For different people for , you know , other places . E_S
45916:17	So , I do n't know . E_S
45917:23	I had n't heard , you know , whether they have a new one or not . E_S
45927:27	But , I mean , I do n't know whether they have one of the first , you know , choices of somebody , E_S
45927:60	But , I mean , I do n't know whether they have one of the first , you know , choices of somebody , E_S
45945:17	But , I do n't know whether they 'll be far enough up where they can do any good *T*-1 . E_S
45990:61	if you were good , boy , * let 's do n't have you on our team , you know . E_S
45998:8	I think 0 they played , uh , N_S
46006:10	You know , they could n't even take handoffs . E_S
46023:44	now he 's the number one rated quarterback in the N F L . I think 0 *T*-1 , E_S
46027:13	I 'm pretty sure 0 he was *?* this past season . E_S
46029:10	and it seems that they 've gotten over their bickering and their fighting as \[ they , \+ problems 0 they \] had *T*-1 in the past E_S
46079:8	I know it . E_S
46122:16	now I do n't know how it will be *T*-1 this year , you know , E_S
46122:48	now I do n't know how it will be *T*-1 this year , you know , E_S
46127:49	It was like I was sitting on the edge of my chair , you know , going oh , no , no . E_S
46140:51	And they had *-1 to kick . \[ And , \+ \] uh , *-2 to know whether we were going *-3 to win the game or lose a game because they got one point ahead of us . E_S
46144:33	So we had *-1 to sit there , you know , E_S
46152:51	I mean , here everybody is sitting on the edge of their chair , you know , E_S
46159:53	and they changed it and gave us another game in the middle of another , you know , one that *T*-1 was going on . E_S
46164:20	The station finally , you know how they 'll put the little message down at the bottom *T*-1 . Started *-2 telling everybody that they were not the ones that *T*-3 had cut that off , that it was the national , you know , N_S
46164:135	The station finally , you know how they 'll put the little message down at the bottom *T*-1 . Started *-2 telling everybody that they were not the ones that *T*-3 had cut that off , that it was the national , you know , N_S
46177:48	I was so mad 0 I got up and went and called , you know , E_S
46178:13	I could n't believe that . E_S
46180:24	we would be ahead , you know , E_S
46181:80	but then \[ at the ver- , \+ in the fourth quarter \] they 'd let them get up there either with them or , you know , right ahead of them . E_S
46201:13	But , \[ maybe we , \+ maybe we 'll \] get your guy . E_S
46201:24	But , \[ maybe we , \+ maybe we 'll \] get your guy . E_S
46203:33	Oh , \[ I , \+ I \] do n't think 0 Jim Kelly is about *-1 to be swayed *-2 away from the Bills any time . E_S

46217:28	I know 0 it 's , you know , worse in the larger cities . E_S
46219:27	in fact , at the moment I 'm thinking of *-1 possibly moving to a new apartment E_S
46222:53	you definitely are going *-1 to worry about the location , and , uh , you know , accessibility *ICH*-3 of people * to be able *-2 to break in . E_S
46224:26	but , \[ I , \+ you know , I 'm \] real concerned that \[ I , \+ I \] do n't want *-1 to be on a first floor where you can have problems with things like that *T*-2 , E_S
46240:56	and , uh , I 'm a little familiar with the city area , Forest Lane and , you know , through that , \[ off , \+ off \] the freeway . E_S
46246:22	And , uh , it did n't seem like it was that congested in \[ that , \+ that \] part . E_S
46247:10	You know because to me where we live *T*-1 out here in the north east , \[ \[ it , \+ it 's \] \+ \] there are a lot of buildings very close to each other , E_S
46252:70	\[ And \+ \] with the , uh , people that *T*-1 are coming into the country from other countries , *-2 not knowing the language E_S

46273:22	And , uh , I do n't know , E_S
46274:26	a lot of younger people , you know , into more violent crimes . E_S
46279:53	\[ \[ Tha- , \+ that , \] \+ that 's \] really sad , you know , E_S

46321:46	she 's old enough * to be alone for a few minutes , you know . E_S

46347:20	And I mean , I think that what this is going *-1 to lead to *T*-2 is 0 people will take things into their own hands . And that innocent people , N_S
46356:80	the reasons that they 're doing it *T*-1 compared to the reason 0 someone else is in jail for it *T*-2 , you know , it 's like two different things . E_S
46362:13	I do n't know , E_S
46367:106	\[ I , \+ I \] like the idea that , uh , if someone is from a foreign country , and they come to this country and uh , commit , a crime , I think that irregardless of whether they have already become a citizen or anything , they should be immediately deported *-1 . E_S

46379:14	and if they know beyond a shadow of a doubt , 0 these people are guilty . E_S
46415:23	and it 's like , you know , um , they live back in \[ whe- , \+ where \] we came from *T*-1 two hundred years ago . E_S
46422:10	You know , \[ whe- , \+ we 've \] advanced beyond that , E_S
46423:10	and I think that their , uh , mentality as far as the way 0 they treat them *T*-1 and that kind of thing , N_S
46424:8	you know what I mean *T*-1 . E_S
46436:10	and I thought 0 Tokyo would be dangerous *-1 being such a huge large city with so many people , E_S
46443:39	and he turned and asked this girl , and said , can you think of any place where Dana should n't go *T*-1 by herself , or anything . E_S
46444:25	And \[ she , \+ she \] thought for a few minutes E_S
46455:8	I thought , boy , in America , if you left a purse on a subway , you would never see it again . E_S
46460:15	You better *-1 believe it , E_S
46471:13	But I was thinking boy , in Dallas , if somebody asked me if there were places 0 you would n't go *T*-1 by yourself at night , I 'd have *-2 to set them down for about five or ten minutes *-2 to list all the places out . E_S
46473:8	Oh sure . E_S
46475:23	I mean , I could n't believe that she could n't think of any place . E_S
46475:38	I mean , I could n't believe that she could n't think of any place . E_S
46480:10	do you know ? E_S
46482:13	I 'm not sure what it is *T*-1 there . E_S
46483:13	Now , I know 0 what it is *T*-1 in Singapore , is 0 they have the death penalty E_S

47137:13	Um , I think 0 Arkansas has one of the best parks departments around . E_S
47147:15	so , that 's probably a pretty nice place 0 * to go *T*-1 . E_S
47151:35	One of them , uh , the gray , I think 0 that 's one of the ones 0 we 've been to *T*-1 , it 's real nice there ,

47178:8	I think 0 we 've collected stuff off and on over the years . E_S
47204:26	the Blue Ridge in North Carolina I think are much nicer E_S

47219:15	but I did n't know \[ how much , \+ how much \] camping areas there were *T*-1 along there . E_S
47221:8	I think 0 there 's quite a few . E_S
47225:8	that seems , like a challenge . E_S
47233:10	You know , you really can probably count thousands of stars , E_S
47233:24	You know , you really can probably count thousands of stars , E_S
47239:8	I think 0 the desert has a rare kind of beauty which , uh , a lot of people do n't realize *T*-1 , E_S

47241:10	and they think of scorpions and snakes and sand and * being real dry , and lack of water , E_S
47243:19	but it also has a certain quality of beauty that you just do n't find *T*-1 anyway else except in a desert . E_S
47267:73	I mean , \[ you got *-1 to , \+ you sort of have *-2 to \] choose your season carefully and know what *T*-3 's going *-4 to happen . E_S
47282:36	The days , get up into the high eighties , uh , maybe the nineties E_S

47333:8	I think 0 we fulfilled our obligation . E_S
47360:72	I guess 0 they paired two women together on this call for a reason which *T*-1 is something 0 we can think about *T*-2 later E_S
47362:8	I know 0 George Bush threw out the first pitch hitter MUMBLEx bounced off the ground E_S
47369:18	I mean , * think , \[ \[ the , \+ he , \] \+ this chain *ICH*-2 \] 0 that must have been *T*-1 on President Bush * to bounce the first pitch off the ground , N_S
47374:27	but at the same time , I do n't know ,

47381:8	men know how *-1 to do that *T*-2 , right ? E_S
47386:8	I know

47397:27	\[ he 's \+ like , I thought 0 he was \] the owner E_S

47447:43	Well , I can tell you , that the Mets opened , I think *RNR*-1 , two days ago , E_S
47466:5	maybe it was the other New York team which *T*-1 is the Yankees , E_S
47470:18	but I do n't even know if they 're still New York Yankees , or MUMBLEx New Jersey . E_S
47482:8	I know . E_S

47488:11	MUMBLEx I thought 0 they were moving to New Jersey . E_S
47489:25	This is how much *ICH*-2 I know *T*-1 about baseball . E_S
47491:41	The Texas Rangers , \[ they , \+ they \] lost , I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
47495:10	But I know that last year N_S
47527:19	and I said , you know what Kyle
47539:33	and nobody brings two children in these seats , you know because , N_S
47545:32	and all the girls were all dressed up MUMBLEx you know , E_S
47546:24	I just was there , you know , E_S
47548:21	I 'm here , you know , E_S

47553:8	I know 0 I 'm always scared of that whenever I go to a game *T*-1 . E_S
47584:59	Last year we wanted *-1 to show my husband what a baseball game was *T*-2 because , you know , *-3 being a non-American you want *-3 to see what a baseball game is like *T*-4 . E_S
47594:35	because we made him try a hot dog , you know MUMBLEx , E_S
47683:8	You probably ca n't afford *-1 to eat if you have more than two of them . E_S
47697:26	we only have one child , you know , E_S
47698:100	\[ they do n't say , \+ they do n't put \] MUMBLEx on bad or anything which *T*-1 is good because it *EXP*-2 would be easy , I 'm sure , for them * to do that , E_S

47726:8	I think 0 that helps a lot . E_S
47727:8	I think 0 that 's the key , in \[ he , \+ like his \] sales last year N_S
47729:8	He probably has an income of thirty-five thousand , E_S
47741:32	* do trust God because , I do n't know , kids are a blessing E_S

47747:28	But you 've got five kids , you know , E_S
47751:21	you 're just as blessed , probably more , because if you follow this , N_S
47756:20	and he 's , you know , N_S

47772:51	\[ they do n't , \+ she does n't \] shop at Foley 's you know , and stuff like that . E_S
47776:28	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't know what Foley 's is *T*-1 . E_S

47787:8	You know what I mean *T*-1 ? E_S
47791:25	You do these fun things , you know , in other kinds of ways E_S
47792:10	and I know 0 Manhattan 's real expensive E_S
47793:42	but , um , it 's kind of a different situation because you 're probably living in an apartment , right ? E_S
47814:14	but , you know , God 's sitting on my heart E_S
47817:8	I think 0 they only have four boys . E_S
47818:16	I do n't even think 0 they have but two old enough * to play yet . E_S
47822:25	But , um , then you did n't believe me about her kids E_S
47834:39	I admire someone that *T*-1 can do that , you know , E_S
47837:8	I know , E_S
47840:23	and they feel like , you know , that 's really why God MUMBLEx N_S
47859:11	I 'd think so . E_S

47869:26	\[ it , \+ it \] just seems like there was always something 0 * to do *T*-1 . E_S

47919:28	but I feel like , I do n't know , when I have children *T*-1 I want *-2 to be able *-3 to spend a lot of time with them . E_S
47938:18	Um , I do n't know , E_S
47939:5	seem , when I was growing up *T*-1 my Mom stayed at home with me and my brother until we were in junior high . E_S
47941:24	\[ it would , \+ I think 0 it was \] very beneficial to us . E_S
47947:14	and , you know , she was just always there for us , E_S
47954:27	and when I was younger *T*-1 I thought 0 they were lucky because they got *-2 to get away with things , like I could n't ride my bike across the street , but they could *?* because their Mom would never know it . E_S

47966:28	Well , \[ that , \+ that \] certainly can happen now if N_S
48046:8	I sure did . E_S
48053:32	usually , uh , my husband was seldom home for maybe forty-five minutes or so E_S
48060:15	and he never ever thought of , uh , *-1 not going to school he said 0 *T*-2 , in view of the fact that he was certain 0 I had a hot line to his school . Because , uh , I , uh , N_S
48060:84	and he never ever thought of , uh , *-1 not going to school he said 0 *T*-2 , in view of the fact that he was certain 0 I had a hot line to his school . Because , uh , I , uh , N_S
48069:15	and so , he thought surely that \[ I , \+ or I \] would have bought a hot line , *-1 to know if he ever skipped school , which , of course , *T*-2 was not the case E_S
48069:18	and so , he thought surely that \[ I , \+ or I \] would have bought a hot line , *-1 to know if he ever skipped school , which , of course , *T*-2 was not the case E_S

48080:44	Uh , I listened to more than one parent say I do n't know what this child wants *T*-1 . E_S
48093:17	And , uh , I think out N_S
48107:19	And , um , you know , \[ we , \+ we \] only had one car , E_S
48108:26	we only had one telephone , you know , E_S
48120:15	And \[ we certainly , \+ uh , we \] need more of that , E_S
48126:15	And that I think 0 *T*-3 has contributed much to , uh , the delinquency that *T*-2 works grant and the poor school results that we 're having *T*-1 . Uh , that the students ' , uh , parents have just not really taken enough interest in them from the \[ very \+ very \] beginning E_S
48127:10	and I think 0 my feeling was that the very best teachers should be in grades one , two , and three . *-3 To get the students off to a good start let them have positive , um , uh , experiences , from the lower levels so they want *-1 to continue *-2 learning and , uh , keep *-2 going and not wait until \[ they 're , \+ they 're \] in the ninth and tenth grades , E_S
48143:101	And , uh , while parents very often will be involved with the school activities when the child 's in the elementary school *T*-1 E_S and they get into the high schools so often they seem *-1 to drop away at that point . E_S
48146:26	It is *?* . Because all the peer pressure , it starts in high school E_S
48176:13	and \[ I know \+ 0 I never ever said that because I knew \] that that was one thing that *T*-1 was really irritating to young people . E_S
48184:90	and then he would have *-1 to make decisions for himself along those same types \[ of , \+ of , \] uh , lines . So that , I think 0 he benefited from my experiences . E_S
48202:18	and we did n't even know it . E_S
48216:92	Well , on a scale of one to ten , uh , being *ICH*-1 ten , no , kind of legislation and zero being , uh , total ban , I probably would lean more towards six or seven . E_S

E_S
48847:35	well , \[ there 's , \+ there 's \] probably two or three different types \[ of , \+ of \] views as far as the controversy goes . E_S
48848:63	I can see where if a life was taken *-1 by accident or , uh , I do n't know what you 'd call it *T*-2 , not premeditated or , I guess primarily by accident , , uh *T*-5 , there may be cases where the death penalty is not called for *-3 *T*-4 , E_S

48850:113	if it 's premeditated or if it 's , uh , kind of a habitual \[ or , \+ or \] \[ a habit that , \+ uh , a tendency that \] people , uh , may get into *T*-1 , then I guess 0 I do n't really have a problem with it . E_S
48857:110	\[ If , \+ if \] you 've got a guy \[ who 's , \+ who *T*-1 's \] been to trial and has been in and out of jail , you know , basically \[ a , \+ a \] three time loser for the twelfth time , you know , and he goes out and kills somebody , he 's not going *-2 to be reformed *-3 , E_S

48880:22	a lot of people do n't think 0 it would be a deterrent , uh , \[ to , \+ to \] future crime , E_S

48898:54	And you can , probably spend , uh , a lot of time , uh , or * maybe eventually , uh , just waiting it out , E_S
48905:44	and that 's where a lot of aggravation comes *T*-1 , I think , \[ is , \+ is , \] uh , these guys spend so much time in the appeal process or just in the waiting process , E_S

49175:18	uh , reasonable construction would probably run you , uh , right now \[ anywhere between , \+ somewhere between \] a hundred and a hundred and forty thousand dollars .

49231:46	like most areas that *T*-1 are built *-2 , um , N_S there were probably , like two or three styles 0 you could choose from *T*-1 . E_S

49289:14	I would have thought , N_S

49313:81	\[ \[ on a , \+ on a , \] \+ on a , \] N_S \[ what we would , \+ you know , what you \] described *T*-2 as your house and what I would describe *T*-1 as my house E_S say , for example , in Pensacola , Florida , on that house with the homestead exemption and so forth and so on , * might pay three or four hundred dollars a year taxes .

49606:18	They 're nice I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
49660:44	, I mean , E_S * buying it right then and , you know , right quickly was kind of impulsive E_S
49661:16	but I 'd been thinking about *-1 buying a new car for about three years E_S
49686:18	Just , I ca n't seem *-1 to get over that . E_S
49688:13	I do n't know why . E_S
49741:13	I do n't know . E_S
49744:13	Well , I think 0 we 're on , maybe . E_S
49744:31	Well , I think 0 we 're on , maybe . E_S
49754:44	Um , well , \[ not , \+ not \] really from , you know , N_S
49756:74	so , uh , the teams 0 I really root for *T*-1 in football are the Niners and the Seahawks , um , you know , mostly because ,
49758:10	you know , like , I like Seattle because I like Seattle E_S
49782:37	But , uh , \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know E_S
49792:99	and , uh , uh , I guess 0 when you 're down here in Dallas *T*-2 you finally get indoctrinated *-1 into the Cowboys um , because , uh , you know this *ICH*-3 is a big football territory down here . E_S
49804:13	I do n't know , E_S
49810:15	Well , you know , \[ you , \+ you \] back the winners E_S
49814:10	But I think , uh , actually , uh , \[ in , \+ in \] *-3 trying *-1 to follow , uh , you know the Cowboys over the years I think , uh , uh , 0 they used *-2 to have \[ a , \+ um , a \] philosophy for , well I do n't know , probably the last twenty-five years except for about the last about five or six years uh ,

49838:29	\[ And , \+ uh , so \] I think 0 it was kind ever interesting . E_S
49839:8	I think 0 the decline \[ of the , \+ uh , of the \] Cowboys as a powerhouse really kind of started with , uh , * not drafting \[ people , \+ the best athletes . \] E_S
49842:24	It makes sense because , you know , \[ you , \+ you 've \] got the flexibility

49852:22	And I do n't , you know , N_S

49859:23	Um , I just , you know , um , N_S
49872:8	I think 0 it was , uh , Minnesota 's MUMBLEx , E_S

49908:73	Spring training until you actually start *-1 going out and \[ getting , \+ uh , getting \] out against the competition everything probably looks pretty good . E_S

49912:37	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ you know , I 'm \] sure 0 if you go to any of the twenty-eight coaches in football in training camp they say , oh , we 're going *-1 to be Super Bowl Champs E_S

50801:15	I do n't , know what we got *T*-1 for all the money . E_S

50845:30	Um , well , like I say , I know that there are some type of programs that they have *T*-1 available for \[ a youth , \+ like teenagers \] to go and do , um , work in the national parks and work in , uh , neighborhoods *-2 to \[ do , \+ \] um , clean up and that sort of thing . E_S

50865:23	and they do fire prevention work and certainly things of that sort . E_S

51087:15	then , you know , *-1 to get it removed *-3 they say , well , you know , 0 *T*-2 you have *-1 to \[ write this , \+ write this \] long detailed letter and everything like that to them , you know , E_S
51087:58	then , you know , *-1 to get it removed *-3 they say , well , you know , 0 *T*-2 you have *-1 to \[ write this , \+ write this \] long detailed letter and everything like that to them , you know , E_S
51087:139	then , you know , *-1 to get it removed *-3 they say , well , you know , 0 *T*-2 you have *-1 to \[ write this , \+ write this \] long detailed letter and everything like that to them , you know , E_S
51106:44	and I said , uh , I just wanted *-3 to let you know that the credit agency 0 you 're using *T*-1 is incorrectly reporting the information that you 're providing *T*-2 to them . E_S
51111:45	So then they can call the credit bureau and say , hey , you know , we 're paying you good money *-1 to report this properly E_S
51117:10	and it seems *-1 to work pretty well so far . E_S
51123:18	Not that I can think of *T*-1 . E_S
51130:26	\[ I , \+ I \] can probably go on , E_S
51135:8	I probably better *-1 let you get back to work . E_S
51196:27	Uh , I could n't tell you for sure . E_S
51210:8	I think 0 that 's right . E_S
51219:8	I think , 0 I 've kind of become a Rangers fan over the last eleven years since I 've been here . E_S
51225:8	I think 0 they 're in for a odd year this year , E_S
51230:40	I mean , the guy 's twenty , twenty-five home rums , maybe thirty , eighty some R B I-s . E_S
51232:32	I mean , \[ he , \+ you know , he \] ca n't field E_S
51233:14	and , you know , he strikes out a lot , E_S
51251:41	of course , * get a guy like Cecil Fielder , you know , E_S
51261:55	all 0 they can do *T*-2 is *-3 hit home runs and strike out you know , which they did *T*-4 . E_S
51270:13	Well , I think 0 the key \[ for , \+ for \] L A this year is whether Oral Herschiser can come back . E_S
51272:8	I think 0 the pitching 's deep enough that it does n't matter . E_S
51274:8	It may be *?* . E_S
51277:8	I think 0 they 're going *-1 to go all the way . E_S
51306:10	you know , he MUMBLEx . N_S
51329:24	and \[ I , \+ you know , I \] do enjoy them . E_S
51336:10	you know , I kind of wish that they had inter league play , like they do in all the other sports so I could see some of the National League teams here once in a while . E_S
51349:22	I , um , N_S you know ,
51385:38	\[ And , \+ and \] you 'll be happy I think 0 *T*-2 in October when the Dodgers win *T*-1 . E_S
51390:39	\[ I 'll be , \+ I 'll be \] upset probably even though my prediction will be right . E_S
51435:40	I could n't have asked for anything better , I do n't think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
51447:20	And this lady , you would think 0 it was her own . E_S
51512:23	so we told her , you know , pro- , N_S
51515:22	So , that way I did n't think , \[ y- , \+ you know , \] 0 the house would be , \[ y- , \+ you know , \] cleaned *-1 or anything for me specifically . E_S
51515:44	So , that way I did n't think , \[ y- , \+ you know , \] 0 the house would be , \[ y- , \+ you know , \] cleaned *-1 or anything for me specifically . E_S
51515:86	So , that way I did n't think , \[ y- , \+ you know , \] 0 the house would be , \[ y- , \+ you know , \] cleaned *-1 or anything for me specifically . E_S
51524:77	And , um , at the time she kept \[ anoth- , \+ one other \] child , um , about a four year old , I believe . E_S
51527:88	and we questioned her about what she fed them *T*-4 and , um , what she did *T*-1 with them during the day and , um , you know , just how she treated them *T*-2 , \[ how , \+ how \] her daughter was *T*-3 with the children when her daughter got home from school *T*-5 and , stuff like that . E_S
51531:20	And , uh , we really seem *-1 to be pleased with her . E_S
51541:43	I , mean , when they see each other *T*-1 , you know , they just love each other to death . E_S
51569:42	Well , I checked a lot of places *ICH*-1 out , you know , the Kinder Cares and the , stuff like that . E_S
51589:37	And they did n't just play all day long . You know , E_S
51596:10	And I thought , well , gosh , that must be pretty good , you know , if everybody 's trying *-1 to incorporate a little bit of it \[ into , \+ into , \] their school . E_S
51596:47	And I thought , well , gosh , that must be pretty good , you know , if everybody 's trying *-1 to incorporate a little bit of it \[ into , \+ into , \] their school . E_S
51603:17	And they made * sure 0 they pointed it out , you know . E_S
51603:43	And they made * sure 0 they pointed it out , you know . E_S
51604:58	But after I looked at this place , and I took Randi with me , uh , I think just about to every place . E_S
51605:18	One place 0 I think 0 I did n't take her *T*-1 . E_S
51634:12	But , she seems to me *-1 to be , you know , pretty quick and smart E_S
51634:38	But , she seems to me *-1 to be , you know , pretty quick and smart E_S
51647:8	I think so . E_S
51657:68	I wanted , *-1 to quit my job so I could stay home with her the next five months , because I know 0 she 's going *-2 to have *-3 to face that . E_S
51666:37	And , oh , my God . Here we go , you know . E_S
51689:17	And , I do n't know , E_S
51690:13	I do n't think 0 this place is a very good place for him . E_S
51707:13	I do n't think 0 she checks things out very well . Which , *T*-1 really surprises me . E_S
51720:8	I know . E_S
51726:13	I do n't know , E_S
51732:18	Um , I do n't know . E_S
51735:32	Too many horror stories out there that , you know . N_S
51740:66	And that 's one reason 0 I like *-3 working up there a little bit *T*-2 is , because I know what *T*-1 's really going on . E_S
51746:8	I think 0 that 's an ideal situation . E_S
51748:16	Because you do n't know , uh , N_S
51762:10	but I thought , well , you know , I 'd like *-1 to see what she 's doing *T*-2 , you , know . E_S
51762:26	but I thought , well , you know , I 'd like *-1 to see what she 's doing *T*-2 , you , know . E_S
51762:76	but I thought , well , you know , I 'd like *-1 to see what she 's doing *T*-2 , you , know . E_S
51766:109	But now that I 'm there , I mean , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] a lot more convenient because there 's so many kids that *T*-1 doddle . You know , when their parents come *T*-2 , E_S
51778:14	so , you know , now it does n't bother me at all E_S
51783:13	I 'm not sure what the street is *T*-1 , E_S
51804:40	but I 've never actually seen the place itself , you , know . E_S
51819:37	because a lot of those places are , like , you know the one over here on seventy-eight , Skaggs . E_S
51830:10	You know , it 's right there on , N_S
51841:54	\[ I 'm scared , \+ I would be scared \] to death 0 my child might accidentally get out , E_S
51842:28	\[ or \+ or , \] if that seems like a real accessible place to where you could , you know , go , in and get one *T*-1 . E_S
51842:66	\[ or \+ or , \] if that seems like a real accessible place to where you could , you know , go , in and get one *T*-1 . E_S
51854:21	\[ Or , \+ you know , or \] a car accident . E_S
51866:14	but , you know , I , that , N_S
51894:13	I do n't know , E_S
51896:11	I do know why
51897:12	because you know , \[ d- , \+ drugs \] and , everything else E_S
51913:8	I know . E_S
51925:69	But , of course , they still have no concept of , what in the world drugs are *T*-1 , you , know E_S
51937:13	But I just think of her , you know , E_S
51937:29	But I just think of her , you know , E_S
51938:70	next year she 's going *-1 to be five , six years old in kindergarten , in same school with , you know , uh , I guess ten year olds . E_S
51939:56	Is n't that , \[ \[ six , \+ sixth , \] \+ sixth \] grade , you know , E_S
51947:54	And \[ that 's , \+ uh , that , \] I can honestly see the peer pressure there . E_S
51958:32	and \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] probably a little too over protective E_S
51964:8	Nothing wrong with that . E_S
51972:34	\[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] think 0 there 's anything wrong with that . E_S
51972:51	\[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] think 0 there 's anything wrong with that . E_S
51974:19	So , I at first thought , you know , when I did n't have kids *T*-1 , N_S
51974:29	So , I at first thought , you know , when I did n't have kids *T*-1 , N_S
51975:51	I was going , God , how can you be so protective *T*-1 ? You , know E_S
51987:23	That 's what I 'm thinking *T*-4 what your mom and dad always used *-1 to say *T*-3 , when you have kids of your own *T*-2 , you 'll understand . E_S
52021:30	I have n't been to a movie theater in probably eight or nine months , E_S
52026:13	but I rent probably four or five movies a week . E_S
52034:50	and , uh , uh , oh gosh , uh , I 'm just trying *-1 to think of all the movies 0 I 've recently seen *T*-2 .
52051:8	I know 0 that sounds funny *-1 coming from a woman , E_S
52061:74	\[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 \[ one of my favorite , \+ well two of my favorite \] movies is probably like LETHAL WEAPON and LETHAL WEAPON TWO . E_S
52092:54	\[ \[ I , \+ I do n't , \] \+ I guess \] 0 I thought 0 it was too far fetched E_S
52093:45	but so many people said oh , no it was n't * , you know . E_S
52100:13	I do n't know , E_S
52102:26	\[ I , \+ I \] just thought 0 it was too far fetched . E_S
52106:44	Um , oh gosh , \[ I don- , \+ I ca n't \] think off my head . E_S
52107:10	Do you know which one yours was *T*-1 ? E_S
52109:40	\[ I , \+ I \] have *-1 to say that probably the one movie that *T*-2 really threw me back the most , uh , that I was really the most in shock with *T*-3 was probably , uh , STAR WARS . E_S
52109:119	\[ I , \+ I \] have *-1 to say that probably the one movie that *T*-2 really threw me back the most , uh , that I was really the most in shock with *T*-3 was probably , uh , STAR WARS . E_S
52119:46	I was ready *-1 to go back and see it again , you know E_S
52126:23	I mean , I do n't think 0 \[ anybody , anything \] could ever beat that . E_S
52145:11	That 's probably something 0 I need *-1 to see *T*-2 right now because I 'm taking history in school . E_S
52149:13	So it 'd probably be a good thing 0 for me to see *T*-1 .
52193:8	I may have *-1 to do that . Go *-2 see it , E_S
52204:82	And , * just \[ kind of , \+ kind of \] go out and , uh , rent all the movies and , uh , uh , you know , just kind of go , N_S
52205:35	I guess 0 you could do that , you know , get all of David Carradine 's movies , or , uh , uh , Segal , E_S
52216:13	I do n't know , E_S
52222:58	It was really kind of interesting because , Arsenio was asking him about , uh , what he thought *T*-1 of , uh , one of the other action guys . E_S
52228:44	* Did n't want *-1 to talk about him because he did n't think 0 he was such \[ a , \+ uh , a \] good action guy . E_S
52243:13	I do n't think 0 he 's really a very good actor . E_S
52244:8	I know 0 that sounds awful because so many people think 0 he 's so wonderful E_S
52244:36	I know 0 that sounds awful because so many people think 0 he 's so wonderful E_S
52254:13	I do n't know ,
52259:36	\[ we , \+ we \] actually rent , uh , probably a \[ go- , \+ good \] combination of movies with the exception of horror films . E_S
52268:10	You know , I do n't know , E_S
52268:23	You know , I do n't know , E_S
52269:65	there 's something about people coming up through the sofa *-1 to get you , or something , you know , coming out of the T V that *T*-2 just does n't make my day , you know . E_S
52269:117	there 's something about people coming up through the sofa *-1 to get you , or something , you know , coming out of the T V that *T*-2 just does n't make my day , you know . E_S
52278:33	So , I just do n't enjoy it , you know , because it 's just like , * come on , give me a break . E_S
52282:10	You know , I mean , I just N_S
52287:10	you know \[ that , \+ it \] just does n't even give you the effect , E_S
52291:13	I do n't know , E_S
52300:8	I thought 0 that was a very good movie . E_S
52310:10	You know , and \[ it was just , \+ it was done *-1 \] so well , you know , E_S
52310:63	You know , and \[ it was just , \+ it was done *-1 \] so well , you know , E_S
52314:10	you know students might try *-1 to do it . E_S
52314:16	you know students might try *-1 to do it . E_S
52315:10	You know , I mean , and it 's not like there 's a lot of scientific data on it . E_S
52318:14	well that 's probably true . E_S
52322:13	\[ It seemed re- , \+ it seemed real , \] E_S
52322:27	\[ It seemed re- , \+ it seemed real , \] E_S
52323:10	you know it was really good . E_S
52334:22	And , um , I do n't know if you like this kind , E_S
52335:10	but I thought 0 PRETTY WOMAN was a really good movie , too . E_S

52353:13	I do n't know if I 've even heard of that one . E_S

52420:11	that 's probably true , E_S
52421:11	that 's probably true . E_S
52453:8	I know that they 're still playing it E_S
52458:10	I , think because \[ they were , \+ they were \] scheduling a video release of it in July E_S
52468:12	and you know , I did n't think 0 that one was near as good . E_S
52468:25	and you know , I did n't think 0 that one was near as good . E_S
52472:10	You know , I guess 0 it was okay , E_S
52475:13	I do n't know . E_S
52502:8	I think that , N_S
52503:13	I do n't know , E_S
52504:32	\[ I don- , \+ I do n't \] think 0 our prison system is n't set *-1 up , where we , um , rehabilitate , or , you know , restore anybody *T*-2 . E_S

52507:8	I think 0 it 'll only make them worse , E_S
52508:27	but , \[ I , \+ I \] believe that God can come in and change a person 's heart and genuinely change it , E_S
52510:52	And if you do kill a person and \[ it is , \+ \] you know , you 're found *-1 to be guilty , I believe 0 *T*-2 God establishes the authority of our court system E_S

52519:31	You still have *-1 to *?* , you know , N_S
52522:10	but I believe 0 if it 's a genuine conversion , there 's a genuine , E_S
52523:18	and those prison people \[ know , \+ they know \] a genuine turnaround in a person 's character , E_S
52523:29	and those prison people \[ know , \+ they know \] a genuine turnaround in a person 's character , E_S
52535:22	You see it , you know the ones that *T*-1 have a genuine character change . E_S
52540:10	And they know that . E_S
52542:8	you know what I 'm saying *T*-1 , E_S
52544:21	So I feel like you know , \[ that 's is , \+ there is \] occasions where \[ there are , \+ they do \] spare lives *T*-1 E_S
52545:14	and , you know , I leave that with the governor , who , *T*-1 of course , is going *-2 to go through every authority because they want *-3 to be be reelected *-4 , E_S
52549:63	but , my concern is , first of all that not \[ all , \+ all \] persons who I think , 0 *T*-1 should be receiving \[ capital , \+ uh , whatever , capital , \] uh , \[ tha- , uh , \+ th- , uh , \] hum , punishment , E_S
52571:73	but the same God that *T*-1 can work that miracle also established the laws that *T*-2 said , um , 0 for certain kinds of sin , certain kinds \[ of , \+ of , \] uh , breaking of the law , there would be a capital punishment . E_S

52609:31	but \[ we 're still , \+ you know , we 're still \] accountable to it . E_S

53762:10	And I think , why do they make us take this stuff *T*-1 ? E_S

54254:10	You know , the Israelis can do anything 0 they want *T*-1 E_S

54264:8	I think 0 it 's unfortunate , uh , as far as the Kurds are concerned *-1 , E_S
54279:44	but you see President Bush is telling them *-1 rebel , you know , uh , uprise . E_S
54291:11	Well I think 0 the war ended too soon . E_S
54299:56	\[ E- , \+ everyone \] 0 I talk to *T*-1 , they says , you know , N_S

54829:11	you 're thinking of Rick Moranis . E_S
54837:28	that 's the one 0 I was thinking of *T*-1 . E_S
54840:8	I think that , uh , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] kind of like , uh , good entertainment . \[ An , \+ uh , an \] escape type of thing . E_S
54871:49	but I 've never seen either \[ \[ of the first , \+ you know , of the , \] \+ of the \] GODFATHER movies E_S
54872:15	so , we 're probably going *-1 to like rent those some time and then try *-2 to see GODFATHER PART THREE somewhere . E_S
54891:24	but , I expected more , I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
54901:54	\[ it 's , \+ it 's \] one of the reasons why , you know THE GODFATHER 's been on our minds lately *T*-1 . E_S

54938:8	I probably saw parts of those . E_S
54939:10	You know , a lot of times \[ I 'll wa- , \+ I 'll start *-1 watching \] a movie E_S
54945:19	next thing 0 you know *T*-1 , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] N_S
54951:15	and then the titles might sound familiar E_S
54952:18	but I really do n't know what they 're all about *T*-1 . E_S
54955:28	of the three of those , DINER 's probably the best . E_S
54966:8	I think 0 I saw that one . E_S
54973:18	Uh , I do n't know , E_S
54975:39	I guess , 0 there are two basic teams that I seem *-1 to follow *T*-2 every year . E_S
55017:20	and , uh , I was probably the only one in the room several times when we were watching football on T V *T*-1 when the Cowboys were playing the Saint Louis Cardinals *T*-2 E_S
55023:16	I really do n't know what *T*-1 's going *-2 to take place with the Cowboys this year . E_S
55026:10	and I think 0 that 's quite a bit of optimism *ICH*-1 around here that still there 's a chance that maybe , uh , these guys are right , maybe they will come through \[ and , \+ and \] do something this year . E_S
55026:69	and I think 0 that 's quite a bit of optimism *ICH*-1 around here that still there 's a chance that maybe , uh , these guys are right , maybe they will come through \[ and , \+ and \] do something this year . E_S

55029:31	Boy \[ they , \+ uh , they \] sure did have a big turn around from a couple of years ago . E_S
55035:12	and you know maybe the stuff that , uh , Jerry Jones is talking about *T*-1 the construction and * redefining the team and maybe the effort might be starting *-2 to pay off . E_S
55035:15	and you know maybe the stuff that , uh , Jerry Jones is talking about *T*-1 the construction and * redefining the team and maybe the effort might be starting *-2 to pay off . E_S

55040:27	They make it to the playoffs it seems 0 *T*-1 for the last few years E_S
55042:12	And you know , they 've got a lot of the tools 0 *-1 to do it *T*-2 , E_S
55043:46	but doggone if they ca n't just put it together , uh , you know , N_S
55044:54	they have got the quarterback there in Randal Cunningham , who *T*-1 's just , you know , phenomenal , E_S
55045:39	but , \[ he , \+ he 's \] too streaky it seems 0 *T*-1 . E_S
55054:12	and you know \[ they , \+ they 've \] managed with those guys E_S
55055:15	and I do n't know . E_S
55057:11	Once the pressure gets turned *-1 on \[ they , \+ they \] seem *-2 to loose it . E_S
55057:44	Once the pressure gets turned *-1 on \[ they , \+ they \] seem *-2 to loose it . E_S
55073:13	I do n't know why it *EXP*-2 's so hard * to find , uh , a good quarterback these days *T*-1 . E_S
55075:71	Well , \[ that , \+ that \] says a lot \[ for the , \+ for his \] ability , though I think 0 *T*-1 .
55081:10	You know , he was one of the few who *T*-1 come through in history that *T*-2 can really perform , E_S
55089:104	it 's difficult in that guy 's position * coming into that because there , he was just so highly touted *-1 by the press and everybody expected so many big things , you know . E_S
55093:20	They put a lot of pressure on him from the outside and from the inside . E_S
55095:11	he 's probably like a lot of quarterbacks , uh , E_S
55096:13	when the pressure is really on *T*-1 when it 's down to the last few minutes of the game for the season *T*-2 is when the guys seem *-3 to really do their best *T*-4 . E_S
55096:87	when the pressure is really on *T*-1 when it 's down to the last few minutes of the game for the season *T*-2 is when the guys seem *-3 to really do their best *T*-4 . E_S
55106:17	So , I do n't know E_S
55110:23	So , obviously though , do you think 0 they 're going *-1 to do anything in the playoffs *-2 to make it to the Super Bowl this year E_S
55114:13	I do n't think 0 the Cowboys have got a chance . E_S
55115:8	I think 0 they will probably win one or two more games than they did this year , E_S
55115:21	I think 0 they will probably win one or two more games than they did this year , E_S
55117:11	They 'll probably get everybody 's hopes up and blow it toward the end . E_S
55124:15	I 'm not real sure . E_S
55129:17	So , I do n't know how these changes are going *-1 to help or hinder the team *T*-2 ,
55134:11	I 'm sure , you know , 0 my sentimental favorite would have *-1 to be Philadelphia , E_S
55134:21	I 'm sure , you know , 0 my sentimental favorite would have *-1 to be Philadelphia , E_S
55135:25	but \[ I , \+ I \] sure am scared of them Giants . E_S
55147:23	\[ That , \+ that \] sure was a fun Super Bowl 0 * to watch *T*-1 this year . E_S
55159:25	And it 's funny , E_S you know .
55197:27	it snowed that much in Denver you know E_S
55198:34	they got that much up in the mountains , you know , just west of there . E_S
55228:10	but I think 0 just the instability of the country right now is , sort of scary . E_S
55289:11	There 's probably five or six , which *T*-1 would be an equivalent of our joint chiefs of staffs , that *T*-2 are in positions over some of these Soviet states . E_S
55304:8	you know , basically the size of , uh , the area around Richardson ? E_S
55330:61	As a civilian that *T*-1 's never been attached *-2 to any form of the military , E_S I know 0 a lot of this stuff that I was involved in *T*-1 , never did make the newspapers . E_S
55345:8	I think 0 \[ we , \+ we \] kind of shoot ourselves in the foot that way too . E_S
55349:30	it 's a matter of money , to a certain extent . E_S
55359:25	It *EXP*-1 's scary * to know that they 're supplying that many people with weapons . Especially when it 's to the south of us *T*-2 . E_S
55381:13	Well , I think 0 Russia is getting to the point where \[ they 're , \+ they 're \] about *-1 to do something *-2 to get out of communism *T*-3 . E_S
55383:8	I think 0 Gorbachev has about had his day . E_S
55396:10	So it may be * trying *-1 to choose between the lesser of two evils , at this point . E_S
55402:13	I do n't know , E_S
55403:8	I sure would n't turn my back on them . E_S
55407:8	I thought 0 that was great . E_S
55412:8	It may be a much reduced force than what we used *-1 to have *T*-2 over there . E_S
55437:25	so I watch the fish , you know .
55443:96	\[ But , \+ and then \] usually after I 'm done *-1 riding the bike , just * to cool myself down , I usually take a walk , you know , E_S
55444:55	and that just kind of \[ gets myself , \+ uh , gets me , \] you know , to where I 'm not quite as tired *T*-1 I guess 0 *T*-2 . E_S
55447:8	You think so ? E_S
55476:13	See , I think 0 that 's what *T*-1 's my biggest problem with * going to \[ a place , \+ uh , \[ a , \+ a \] health club . \] E_S
55478:10	You know , so I have tried *-1 to just do stuff at home E_S
55480:34	I mean , I 'm not big , you know , or anything , E_S
55498:69	And \[ \[ \[ it 's , \+ uh , oh , it 's just , \] \+ I do n't know , it 's , \] \+ it 's \] a total free relaxation . E_S
55557:17	I never would have thought of that . E_S
55568:62	They 're just little terry cloth things 0 you wear *T*-1 for house slippers *ICH*-2 with rubber , you know , soles , so that , you know , N_S
55568:83	They 're just little terry cloth things 0 you wear *T*-1 for house slippers *ICH*-2 with rubber , you know , soles , so that , you know , N_S
55581:15	But , I never think about it until after you go there for about a week , your toes , you start *-1 getting blisters anyway . E_S
55604:10	You know , \[ it , \+ it , \] N_S
55606:10	But I know that I have *-1 to do it . E_S
55607:98	I mean \[ it 's just , \+ \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] \] not a question of whether I want *-1 to *?* , you know . E_S
55667:32	I guess then 0 the water aerobics would be probably the best thing for you , would n't it *?* ? E_S
55765:8	I think 0 I have gone home maybe once or twice *-1 slightly sore . E_S
55765:28	I think 0 I have gone home maybe once or twice *-1 slightly sore . E_S
55789:18	That 's , you know , N_S
55795:15	And I do n't know , E_S
55797:18	I 'm considering *-1 maybe even buying one of those too . E_S
55798:15	But I 'm not sure if I 'll get benefit out of both of them . E_S
55799:23	I mean , I do n't know if it *EXP*-2 would really do any good *-1 having both of them . E_S
55812:32	So you have a \[ little , \+ you know , little , \] N_S
55819:8	I think 0 now that I 've had the bicycle , E_S I would go to the stepper . E_S
55828:25	Because it all depends , you know , for everyone their own what they want *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S
55850:13	I do n't know , E_S
55851:46	\[ I 've been , \+ I 've been \] sitting here *-1 thinking , E_S

55854:64	Well , you know , \[ I 'm \+ like , I 'm \] not really sure what I think *T*-1 about this . E_S

56346:51	and then I put the , uh , shrimp around the outside of it , you know , on my platter . E_S
56354:14	And , you know , you have all the different seasonings and stuff , E_S
56360:34	and it makes it a real nice looking , you know . E_S
56368:26	But it looks like it , you know . E_S
56381:61	And , uh , usually I cut those little cherry tomatoes up , and put some color into it , you know , E_S
56385:41	and I 'll lay those on top of my salad , you know , *-1 to make it look nice and things like that . E_S

56429:10	You know , they want it from down here . E_S
56436:58	Because , just like now , especially crawfish , it is starting *-1 to move out , you know , E_S
56455:45	I mean , it 's got a taste of its own , you know , E_S
56480:25	Um , \[ * let me think of , \+ I ca n't even think of \] what you , N_S

56535:35	But , uh , do you have *-1 to have a certain skillet , or something ? E_S

56558:10	You know , I never have *?* . E_S
56581:10	You know , I mean , that is a seasoning . E_S

56665:56	Um , you do n't even have *-1 to go all the way to New Orleans , you know , if you want *-2 to really get some good food . E_S
56697:54	We go to the ones that they tell us to go to *T*-1 , you know . E_S

56774:59	and , it those who *T*-1 do n't vote would have voted exactly the same way , you know , in other words if forty percent had voted for that person and sixty percent for the other , just like everyone who *T*-4 did vote , it *EXP*-5 's not clear to me that it is really a problem , um . E_S
56777:14	because I had thought , N_S
56782:83	I mean if you look at the break down of those who *T*-1 do n't vote , they tend *-2 to be , you know , N_S
56785:15	But I do n't know if that 's the case . E_S
56791:16	Apparently they do n't think 0 it 's a problem . E_S
56806:28	The first really \[ popular , \+ you know wide spread \] one was , uh , Proposition Thirteen which *T*-1 was a , uh , tax revolt , against property taxes . E_S

57237:14	but , you know , \[ if he had the preference , \+ I mean \[ his , \+ his \] preference \] is , um , blue jeans and a t-shirt , E_S

57301:28	Uh , \[ whe- , \+ you know , when \] they were coming up *T*-1 , \[ I , \+ I \] did n't sew , E_S
57319:44	because clothes \[ are s- , \+ are really \] expensive . You know , E_S
57323:48	uh , uh , a little simple \[ shell , \+ shell \] blouse , you know , that you can make *T*-1 for about , say ten dollars \[ \[ at , \+ you know , at , \] \+ at \] the most out of a decent fabric , boy , runs you like twenty something dollars in the store . E_S

57330:43	Just a little shell 0 *T*-1 to go under a suit , you know . E_S
57356:15	And then , * seems like every time 0 she turned around *T*-1 he was outgrowing stuff . E_S
57360:44	And she finally learned that you just can not do this , you know . E_S
57361:50	So now she finds the basement sales \[ and , \+ \] just like , you know , everybody else . E_S
57364:21	I mean , I always thought 0 my mom was being mean to me E_S
57371:18	Um , I do n't know , E_S

57386:115	\[ \[ If you , \+ if you , \] \+ if you 're \] not buying the most expensive clothes out there \[ the , \+ the \] quality is really not that great , you know , for the price that you pay *T*-1 . E_S

57465:8	I think 0 the last thing 0 I did *T*-1 of any significance was * change the water pump on an Oldsmobile . E_S
57474:8	I know what you mean *T*-1 . E_S
57476:14	So , you know , * changing the oil , changing the spark plugs N_S
57477:27	and most of them now , you know , you do n't go through the ignition stuff anymore because that 's all solid state \[ or , \+ or \] fuel injected E_S
57500:10	You know , they 've gotten so complicated or so high tech that , uh , \[ the guys , \+ average guys \] ca n't really go out \[ in the , \+ in the \] garage and do a whole lot of repairs ,
57542:21	You 're right , you know , E_S

57559:49	I mean , though for what you could get *T*-1 for one , you might as well drive it over a cliff . E_S
57568:13	and that was probably one of the most miserable things 0 I had gotten into *T*-1 in a long time . E_S

57580:8	I think 0 the \[ onl- , \+ closest \] thing 0 I 've come *T*-2 \[ to , \+ to \] a diesel is , 0 I 've worked for a tractor repair shop , uh , when I was in high school *T*-1 E_S
57588:34	Well the injector nozzle and stuff in , you know , the big diesel farm tractors , you know , what *T*-1 are about the size of your thumb , E_S and the- , N_S

57601:34	and he drove it literally into the ground , you know . E_S
57610:13	I do n't know exactly why . E_S
57614:13	I do n't know if it 's still , uh , limited like it was *?* , E_S
57615:22	I do n't notice it , probably because I don- , N_S
57626:7	but maybe because I 'm not looking for it . E_S
57629:62	well I 'd bought , uh , a G M C diesel pickup and , uh , loved that thing , you know , E_S
57635:57	and it was the van that I needed *T*-1 then , *-2 to buy the , you know , N_S
57637:17	But , uh , * sure enjoyed it . E_S
57647:56	and , uh , if you treat them right , they 're not the gas guzzlers 0 I think that they 've got the reputation * to be *T*-1 . E_S
57651:52	I 'm convinced that , uh , Detroit or whoever it is *T*-1 made a major mistake , years ago when they stopped *-2 putting the small V eights in and went to the fours and some of the sixes *T*-3 . E_S
57669:8	I think 0 \[ that little , \+ the little \] Chevy V eight when it started out \[ in sixty , \+ in fifty-five , \] I think *T*-1 was two sixty-five , something like that . N_S

57673:17	Little , you know , not whole lot more \[ \[ than the , \+ than the , \] \+ than the \] six cylinder that I think 0 *T*-1 was like about two thirty-five or so . N_S

57674:120	But , uh , they kept *-1 boring that block out to where you could a get a \[ four hundred , \+ small block four hundred \] that *T*-2 was , uh , the same block *T*-3 , you know , \[ just , \+ just \] kept *-1 boring it out and boring it out and stroking it a little bit more , an . N_S
57676:8	I think 0 \[ those gu- , \+ those little \] V eights could have been made *-1 to be pretty powerful little engines , if they would have gone with it , E_S
57687:81	and it 's fairly easy 0 * to work with *T*-1 because there 's not just a whole lot in it 0 *T*-2 to go wrong ,
57688:21	\[ and \+ \] you know changing the plugs and stuff . E_S

57744:19	And he 'd never really thought about it . E_S
57757:54	Well when they went to the , N_S started with the newer engines *T*-1 , you know , E_S when they started *-2 putting all that pollution control stuff on the older engines *T*-3 is where they started *-4 getting into so much , you know , trouble *T*-5 .

57793:38	I 've got an , an Olds Toronado that , I think 0 *T*-1 's got six belts on the sucker . E_S

57824:28	so I guess 0 I 've done probably , uh , I 'd say seven or eight of them . E_S

57857:47	Uh , I have , uh , I guess 0 *T*-1 a lot of thoughts about the Vietnam War , um , E_S
57859:16	and so there 's probably a lot of things 0 I remember *T*-1 and a lot of things that I really did n't have a clue as to what *T*-2 was happening *T*-3 . E_S
57863:25	Um , * looking back , like maybe some of the things that I know *T*-1 now , \[ I , \+ I 'm \] not sure 0 I do believe 0 it was worth the cost in dollars and lives . E_S

57890:19	Do n't you think that maybe that 's why we had it this time *T*-1 ? E_S
57891:19	I mean I do think that , \[ \[ i- , \+ i- , \] \+ it 's \] been too long in * coming E_S
57892:17	but I feel like maybe the American people \[ and , \+ and \] the government are aware of the things that we did *T*-1 wrong that we did n't support \[ \[ that , \+ that \] \+ those , \] E_S

57920:56	and \[ I , \+ I \] agree with you that \[ I , \+ I \] think that \[ the , \+ the \] time difference between the two wars has allowed a lot of people to see the mistakes that *T*-1 were made *-2 \[ \[ in , \+ in , \] \+ in \] every aspect of it E_S

58004:8	I know , E_S
58005:11	I do think that in the Middle East war , um , N_S

58070:38	Uh , but , I remember the feeling back then , you know , E_S

58094:66	when this war broke out *T*-1 it frustrated me all \[ thi- , \+ the \] antiwar people and , you know , \[ their , \+ all the \] demonstrations that *T*-2 were going on . E_S
58099:43	because \[ those kind of people , \+ I mean , you know , they 're the kind of people \] \[ who *T*-1 are , \+ who *T*-2 've \] always got *-3 to have a cause , whether it 's good , bad of indifferent . E_S

58128:22	\[ I , \+ you know , I 'm \] sorry that you 're opposed to the war . E_S

58200:37	Well , uh , \[ what \+ what \] do you think *T*-1 about the metric system ? E_S
58232:15	Um , the secret seeming to me * to be * to not bother ever *-2 converting inches to centimeters and , pounds to \[ kilom- , \+ uh , uh , kilograms , \] E_S
58239:12	and , I think 0 that 's what *T*-1 hung people up the most is 0 they went now * wait a minute ,
58248:150	And the problem is that we tried *-1 to convert everything from inches to centimeters * preserving basically the inches but expressing them as centimeters rather than * saying no , a centimeter is about the width of your thumbnail , or whatever , \[ and , \+ you know , and \] leaving it at that E_S
58249:19	and , uh , you know , a kilogram weighs about this much E_S

58295:104	I guess , 0 my feeling is 0 the way 0 * to do it *T*-1 \[ is , \+ is \] * to just start *-2 giving weights , you know , have a very brief transition period and then just start *-3 giving weights and kilometers , er , just as in kilometers and weights and kilograms and everything like that and , uh , just have people start *-4 using it rather than having people constantly trying *-5 to convert . E_S
58307:38	every time 0 I see something like that *T*-1 I think , well , \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] an anti-metric argument . E_S
58310:38	Well , uh , \[ I , \+ I \] do n't think 0 \[ it 'll , \+ it \] could ever happen \[ with , \+ with \] a quick transition . E_S
58315:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 that would be the easiest way E_S
58316:41	but human nature being such as it is *?* , I would think 0 it would take , probably , two or three years before people \[ co- , \+ could \] completely cut the cord . E_S

58324:25	I did n't mean , you know , I did n't mean like Sweden going over to right hand drive or anything , you know , E_S

58329:13	Uh , I believe so , E_S
58331:10	and I think 0 they did it overnight E_S

58345:14	but , you know , that must have taken , uh , N_S

58359:11	I 'm sure . E_S
58361:75	Um , so \[ \[ \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I , \] \+ I , \] \+ I \] think 0 it *EXP*-1 's essential that it 's done E_S

58655:14	there 's a certain amount of meatless meals 0 you have *-1 to have *T*-2 . E_S

59047:19	and , uh , you know , it , N_S
59057:35	I mean , just \[ the , \+ you know , the \] cost of living

59077:48	I said my goodness , what is it , lined *-1 in gold , you know , uh . E_S

59326:13	I do n't know if the T I in Dallas does or not . E_S

59338:67	Um , E_S I guess 0 on \[ a one , \+ a scale \] of one of ten I 'm probably around a two in terms of fair * restricting guns E_S

59642:15	and I do n't know that that 's not a good idea . E_S
59646:25	um , uh , that , you know , N_S
59647:8	they probably , need *-1 to change it somehow , uh , E_S
59649:87	we 've just got too many people in there , and , uh , MUMBLEx , are putting too many , uh , people *ICH*-1 in jail that *T*-2 probably do n't need *-3 to be there E_S
59657:40	But on that one thing , \[ I , \+ I \] still think 0 it should be a unanimous decision , E_S
59663:13	uh , I think 0 we 're getting to the point *ICH*-1 now where they 're going *-2 to eventually let it be , um , majority vote *T*-3 . E_S
59672:8	I know 0 my husband served \[ on a , \+ on a \] jury a few months ago up here in Denton , E_S
59688:19	and , uh , you know , they were told *-1 that , you know , during the trial that this is this guy 's first offense E_S
59688:47	and , uh , you know , they were told *-1 that , you know , during the trial that this is this guy 's first offense E_S
59691:17	the jury , you know , decided , hey , it 's time 0 * to crackdown here *T*-1 , you know , E_S
59691:71	the jury , you know , decided , hey , it 's time 0 * to crackdown here *T*-1 , you know , E_S
59695:32	and they sentenced him to fifteen years , you know , which \[ they thought first offense , okay , this is , \+ they thought \] that \[ that was , \+ *T*-1 that was \] a good thing . E_S
59695:50	and they sentenced him to fifteen years , you know , which \[ they thought first offense , okay , this is , \+ they thought \] that \[ that was , \+ *T*-1 that was \] a good thing . E_S

59701:37	and they were told *-1 that , uh , he would probably serve three , of the fifteen , and that he had three previous convictions . E_S
59712:19	So , the jury did n't know about it , E_S
59713:25	so here they based their sentencing *-1 thinking that this was this guy 's first offense , E_S
59717:26	\[ and \+ so , \] you know , we 'll give him fifteen which *T*-1 will teach him a lesson E_S
59718:35	but it 's \[ not \+ just , \] you know , horrible , since it was first offense E_S
59722:37	and he 'd been convicted *-1 three times before , you know , E_S
59728:75	I mean , he felt \[ like \+ \] \[ that , \+ that \] they had been tricked *-1 , you know , E_S
59733:65	I wonder if a judge did n't have control of that if some of that would change , you know . E_S
59736:10	the judge might know E_S
59736:13	the judge might know E_S
59753:40	obviously what we are doing *T*-1 is not working , you know . E_S

59767:45	or when they get out *T*-1 \[ they 're , \+ you know , it 's \] a matter of a few months E_S
59783:20	and I said , you know , 0 I understand that there are a lot of countries that *T*-1 rely on the United States , * to N_S

59841:81	I just have this problem with , uh , * trying *-1 to heal the world when you 're so sick yourself *T*-2 , you know , E_S
59848:13	Well , we seem *-1 to agree on the jury thing E_S

59887:29	\[ we had cat , \+ you know , my family had cats \] when we were growing up *T*-1 the whole time until my Mom developed an allergies , E_S

59923:26	\[ we were , \+ you know , we were \] sitting the dog and everything E_S

59954:26	\[ it 's , \+ you know , it 's \] a pain 0 * to clean *T*-1 E_S

59989:27	Then I would do it , you know , everyday or two days so I would clean that pan very , very rarely , E_S
60018:14	and , you know , just * was not mature enough *-1 to keep the dog , did n't realize how much work it was *T*-2 E_S
60024:10	but I think that for me , well , my husband just has completely nixed the idea of * having a dog or a cat . E_S
60028:12	So , you know , N_S
60045:39	Uh , \[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] know because the cats pretty much , um , N_S
60053:14	but , you know , \[ they , \+ they 're \] pretty much okay by themselves , E_S

60060:19	and their cats , you know , they 're so used to the attention , that if they do n't get it , they get really upset , E_S
60064:14	and , you know , they sort of cause trouble around the house and things like that . E_S
60074:29	But they 're not that much fun , you know , E_S
60076:20	you ca n't , you know , N_S
60077:59	\[ they , \+ \[ they do n't , \+ they ca n't \] \] fetch , you know , E_S

60112:33	my brother had asthma and some allergies which I think 0 he 's outgrown *T*-1 now , E_S
60126:32	\[ I just , \+ I \] do n't know , E_S

60149:33	I could see \[ some \+ *-1 having , maybe some \] of the tropical fish , that *T*-2 are really , really pretty E_S
60152:98	Like , I remember a friend of mine at work telling me that at his frat in college that they had a tank of piranha , and , uh , you know , used *-1 to drop mice in MUMBLEx E_S
60156:46	\[ this is not , \+ these are n't \] cats , , you know , E_S
60196:8	I think 0 she got it , N_S
60197:8	I think 0 she was a psych major E_S
60204:50	and the people in the lab one day called in my friend and said , you know , this rat is acting really strange
60205:8	I think 0 he 's sick , E_S
60206:24	and she said , I do n't think 0 he 's sick ,
60207:8	I think 0 she 's pregnant , . E_S
60214:34	and I got her when she was , you know , just this tiniest little thing like , half the price of a mouse *T*-1 , E_S
60218:33	and then she grew *-1 to be , you know , N_S
60220:39	and then she grew *-1 to be pretty big , you know , like a pound or something E_S
60224:13	I do n't know how much , E_S
60227:18	She would , you know , crawl on me E_S
60228:86	and she would sit like on my neck or my shoulder while I was working , and things like that . Yeah , much more than you would think . E_S
60234:20	I mean , you know , if you get them *-1 young and everything before they go , kind of nuts , N_S
60248:14	and , you know , it was \[ easy . \+ Easy \] 0 * to take care of *T*-1 E_S
60261:36	again it gets into vivant much fun , , you know what , I guess 0 they can be *?* . E_S
60264:30	Actually it was more fun than you would think . Yeah , * starting from the beginning E_S
60272:59	it *EXP*-1 's not fair to a pet *ICH*-2 * to have a pet here , or \[ certainly , \+ certainly \] not a dog , E_S
60272:67	it *EXP*-1 's not fair to a pet *ICH*-2 * to have a pet here , or \[ certainly , \+ certainly \] not a dog , E_S
60284:14	so , you know . N_S
60305:10	but I think 0 they 're actually supposed *-1 to , MUMBLEx \[ keep them , \+ yeah , keep them \] clean E_S
60315:37	last time 0 I was there *T*-1 was fall so probably was n't that bad . E_S
60328:8	I think 0 * was the last time 0 I was \[ up , \+ up \] there and at Center Park *T*-1 . E_S
60351:60	my wife got them from , uh , um , friend of hers at work and everything , you know , you know , as kittens , E_S
60351:70	my wife got them from , uh , um , friend of hers at work and everything , you know , you know , as kittens , E_S
60357:17	And um , you know , they 're really cute , E_S
60364:31	Apparently \[ w- , \+ I \] do n't know all the details E_S
60370:10	You know , the scr- , N_S
60374:80	\[ both , \+ yeah , both \] females , they 're both spayed , um , or whatever it is *T*-1 , neutered , you know , , um , E_S
60407:25	well , I , uh , you know , around with my hands and things like that N_S
60410:18	So , um , I think 0 I 'm MUMBLEx in handicraft . E_S
60414:8	I think 0 it will become resume writing . E_S
60419:33	\[ I , \+ I \] hate *-1 to think about it E_S
60430:12	who *T*-1 knows . E_S
60440:11	I 'm sure 0 the number 's \[ s- , \+ somewhere \] classified E_S
60468:16	Well , I 'm sure 0 with the new , uh , \[ aw- , \+ contract awarding \] N_S
60469:24	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 it went to Lockheed , did n't it ? E_S
60531:57	I should have taken \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the , \] you know , uh , option when that was there *T*-1 , E_S
60533:14	But , you know , what can one do *T*-1 . E_S
60542:14	but , you know , as you get *-1 to know more of the people that *T*-2 work there and more of what *T*-3 's going on with the system , N_S
60542:36	but , you know , as you get *-1 to know more of the people that *T*-2 work there and more of what *T*-3 's going on with the system , N_S
60544:31	\[ it 's , \+ uh , you know , it all starts \] *-1 to become similar E_S
60545:26	\[ there 's , \+ you know , there 's \] benefits E_S
60565:40	and there 's lots and lots of companies that *T*-1 have maybe not in \[ the de- , \+ the defense \] area but manufacturing in general . N_S
60573:24	\[ And , \+ and \] I seem rather happy about it *ICH*-2 most of the time , *-3 \[ just , \+ just \] to know , what 's , possibilities *T*-1 are , you know , what *T*-4 might happen . E_S

60589:8	I know a number of people who *T*-1 are , uh , surplused E_S
60593:87	So , despite the fact that I should be tying flies or fly fishing \[ or , \+ or \] going for walks in the mountains , I ca n't seem *-1 to get into it right now . E_S
60599:16	well , I 'm sure 0 it 's just with \[ \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] the , \] \+ the \] way that things are so topsy-turvy right now *T*-1 as soon as you \[ dec- , \+ decide \] on a pass , N_S
60623:56	Well , actually , uh , \[ the , \+ the \] Plano , Dallas , Houston , you know , Austin that whole area \[ is , \+ is \] actually \[ quite , \+ quite \] nice . E_S
60681:21	I can imagine , you know , 0 the longer and longer 0 it goes *T*-1 , N_S
60705:7	And maybe I 'll wet a fly line this year and do some camping if I do n't get laid *-1 off between now and then . E_S
60729:24	Um , well , what do you think 0 *T*-1 is , uh , \[ the pollutants , \+ the main pollutants \] in the air ? E_S
60732:32	\[ I just , \+ uh , I \] think 0 they put off so much E_S
60739:15	and I 'm not sure that about yesterday ,
60741:53	but the day before they had a lot of programs about the environment and , you know , how we 're affecting the Earth and things by what we do *T*-1 , as the people *T*-2 E_S
60749:43	and that actually , um , as our population increases and , you know , \[ \[ \[ our , \+ of course , our , \] \+ our cars , \] \+ you know , our number of cars *ICH*-1 \] increase per the population , that 's the problem .
60749:107	and that actually , um , as our population increases and , you know , \[ \[ \[ our , \+ of course , our , \] \+ our cars , \] \+ you know , our number of cars *ICH*-1 \] increase per the population , that 's the problem .
60751:14	and , you know , \[ their reg- , \+ their regulation \] that *T*-2 's placed *-3 on them \[ is , \+ I mean , it 's \] better than it used *-1 to be *?* E_S
60752:57	but it *EXP*-3 's incredible that \[ \[ they still do n't have , \+ you know , they do n't , \] \+ they 're not made \] *-1 to regulate the amount of pollutants that they put *T*-2 into the air . E_S
60756:10	You know , \[ I , \+ I \] just , N_S
60758:10	and I know for a fact that they get away with a lot that , N_S
60759:10	you know , they 're supposed *-1 to be regulated *-1 because \[ \[ we have a , \+ we have a \] plant , \+ I do n't know about T I but we have \[ a plant , \+ uh , a Pillsbury plant , \] \] \[ in , \+ in \] a town adjacent to ours , E_S

60763:10	and I know people that *T*-1 work there that , N_S
60764:21	of course , you would n't think 0 Pillsbury would put out certain chemicals , E_S
60764:40	of course , you would n't think 0 Pillsbury would put out certain chemicals , E_S
60777:45	And , um , they said that \[ they 're , \+ you know , they have \] a little creek that *T*-1 runs by them E_S
60778:80	and some of the people that *T*-1 work there have told me that when they have inspectors coming *T*-2 they , you know , shut down everything E_S and they clean up their act , but on a normal basis \[ that they 're , \+ that they 're \] dumping things , that they 're not supposed *-1 to be dumping *T*-2 , E_S
60789:16	I would n't have thought that Pillsbury \[ \[ could , \+ would , the , \] \+ I mean , or even had \] chem- , \+ you know , well , N_S
60789:93	I would n't have thought that Pillsbury \[ \[ could , \+ would , the , \] \+ I mean , or even had \] chem- , \+ you know , well , N_S
60793:64	they have chemicals that they use *T*-1 *-2 to refine their flours with *?* and stuff , you know 0 *T*-3 \[ to , \+ to \] break the flours down E_S
60799:10	you know , \[ wh- , \+ when \] you consider , you know , 0 it 's probably not radioactive *T*-1 E_S
60799:47	you know , \[ wh- , \+ when \] you consider , you know , 0 it 's probably not radioactive *T*-1 E_S
60799:62	you know , \[ wh- , \+ when \] you consider , you know , 0 it 's probably not radioactive *T*-1 E_S
60805:56	So , there could be a lot of things that they could put *T*-1 , you know , that chemical wise that they use *T*-4 *-5 to , uh , that they are testing with *T*-3 , that they 're dumping *T*-2 . E_S
60808:10	you know , like \[ in , \+ In \] packaging E_S
60812:19	and , uh , you know , just goodness . N_S
60815:13	I do n't think 0 they do the packaging at this plant , E_S
60829:27	Uh , only thing 0 I can think *T*-1 is bleaching E_S
60830:42	but , I mean , \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know \[ what *T*-2 's , \+ \] how they do the flour *T*-1 . E_S
60844:47	\[ but , \+ uh , and \] \[ they 're , \+ you know , they 're \] right there on the creek also E_S
60852:18	I mean , you think about \[ it , \+ it , \] you know , E_S
60852:49	I mean , you think about \[ it , \+ it , \] you know , E_S
60853:15	it *EXP*-2 's probably a lot easier *ICH*-4 * to detect things that *T*-1 go into the ground than it *EXP*-3 is maybe *?* * to just , N_S
60853:77	it *EXP*-2 's probably a lot easier *ICH*-4 * to detect things that *T*-1 go into the ground than it *EXP*-3 is maybe *?* * to just , N_S
60854:16	I 'm not really sure E_S
60855:13	but I would think 0 it *EXP*-1 would be easier * to detect those things because you could detect them down \[ strean- , \+ or stream \] or such , E_S
60859:39	or \[ you can , \+ you can , \] you know , do , uh , testing on the ground itself at that point , E_S
60863:56	but when they pollute into the air *T*-2 \[ and you 've got , \+ you know , and you 've got \] movement through the air *T*-2 , it 's going *-1 to move a lot of that off . E_S
60864:27	So , I do n't see , you know , how they can do some of the te- *T*-1 , N_S
60865:63	unless it just hangs there like in places where it 's a lot of pollution *T*-3 , you know , like in Los Angeles \[ or , \+ or \] the bigger cities where \[ it , \+ it \] tends *-1 to get stuck *-2 there *T*-4 , N_S
60869:8	you know , that you have a lot more particles in the air , you know , \[ \[ \[ per , \+ per , \] \+ uh , per \] \+ particles \] in the surrounding community because it 's not moved *-1 away , E_S

60879:8	I know that , E_S
60886:10	and I think , well , what if somebody 's dumped something back there in the , and no one knows about it and , you know , it sinked in through the ground and all that , E_S
60886:62	and I think , well , what if somebody 's dumped something back there in the , and no one knows about it and , you know , it sinked in through the ground and all that , E_S

61355:8	I think that if somebody else picks him up , N_S
61356:8	I think that , uh , if he gets out he 'll come back . E_S
61360:10	You know . I really do , because he knows exactly where he lives *T*-1 , E_S

61401:45	You know , they can get hurt *-1 a lot easier , you know , E_S
61408:51	so that would make you really , tend *-1 to worry about them , you know , if they 're not right there E_S
61427:12	and , I think 0 maybe he would *?* if it came real close , E_S
61427:19	and , I think 0 maybe he would *?* if it came real close , E_S
61432:41	\[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 I really do n't know cats that well because my mother never liked them , E_S

61441:29	so I 've never owned one , you know , since I , N_S
61445:95	but if you want him to be *?* and he does n't want *-1 to be *?* , \[ he 'll just , \+ he 'll , \] you know either scratch you or run away . E_S

61456:22	They 're always , you know , right there *ICH*-1 , and \[ like , \+ like \] you to pet them and loving . E_S
61461:55	and \[ they 'll , \+ they 'll \] put their head underneath your hand , you know . E_S
61474:13	I do n't know any that *T*-1 really do n't . E_S
61475:20	I mean , you know , they know exactly how * to get that attention *T*-1 , you know , E_S

61475:63	I mean , you know , they know exactly how * to get that attention *T*-1 , you know , E_S
61477:8	They sure do . E_S
61479:18	they just , you know , come up , E_S
61480:23	and they put your , you know N_S
61484:49	or they 'll rub \[ their , \+ their \] head against you , you know . E_S
61500:64	That 's why we could n't understand why he would want *-2 to get out *T*-3 , you know , because he 's had all this room 0 * to run in *T*-1 *T*-4 , E_S
61513:14	and , you know , \[ we , \+ we \] filled it back up put him back in there . E_S
61525:10	you know , but we really did n't want *-1 to keep him chained *-2 up because , you know , we feel like that 's just too restricting for him . E_S

61540:69	I do n't understand , you know , because it 's , like , he 's got a good home , you know , E_S
61542:34	I mean , we have two kids , you know , that *T*-1 just love him a lot , E_S

61558:21	I guess 0 that 's probably true . E_S
61559:13	I do n't think 0 it 's anything 0 we did *T*-1 . E_S

61576:10	You know , it 's like , N_S

61657:13	I did not know that . E_S
61662:21	I knew 0 something was wrong with him because his appetite was , N_S

61716:10	But I think 0 you you really hit the nail on the head . E_S
61738:29	well , actually one other thing 0 I might ought *-2 to mention *T*-1 is that they are actually getting quite cheap . E_S
61755:8	they sure do . E_S
61757:14	I actually was thinking about * upgrading mine very recently and kind of look at the whole spectrum . E_S
61801:5	probably the way 0 * to do it if you really wanted *-1 to buy one *T*-2 is 0 there 's a magazine called * COMPUTER SHOPPER . E_S
61810:13	and it 's probably an inch thick a thousand pages . E_S
61827:11	it 's probably a half a dozen companies *ICH*-2 around the world that *T*-1 are making those mother boards , the main computer , the circuit board . E_S
61832:24	They 're available in , you know , the B Daltons , \[ that \+ that \] type of thing . E_S
61864:50	Course \[ it 's \+ it 's \] kind of an inside joke , you know . E_S
61938:8	they certainly are *?* . E_S

61964:29	Well , I do n't know if I know anything or not , E_S
61973:72	See those type of people \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-2 have the most opinions , ones that *T*-1 do n't know anything . E_S
61979:15	and I do n't know that it *EXP*-1 might do them a little bit of good * to see the world from a different perspective . E_S

61980:13	Uh , I think 0 this `` me '' generation has gone far too far . E_S

61986:16	Uh , I personally know nothing about the Peace Corps though . E_S
62001:8	I know that , uh , my sister , N_S

62009:24	If it 's like , you know , really \[ a , \+ you know , a \] lower paying job , you know , where in a small town you do n't obviously you do n't need as much as far as *-1 \[ to , \+ you know , to \] live *T*-2 . N_S

62024:8	I know that also one of my cousins who , uh , *T*-1 he is in like the therapy type thing E_S
62027:44	but then he was required *-1 to go back and work for a certain number of years in this town at , uh , uh , N_S

62033:8	I think 0 that 's a good way \[ for people to , \+ you know , maybe get people to \] come back to these small towns *-3 to work by *-4 helping people that *T*-1 normally might not be able *-2 to go to college and get the type of degree 0 they want *T*-5 . E_S

63505:11	Because I think 0 the Wentworth *RNR*-1 and the S A E *RNR*-1 bolt sizes were the same , E_S
63513:68	Matter of fact , the thing is , 0 I always say 0 it 's built *-1 off shore , you know , because it was assembled *-2 in Canada . E_S
63517:23	and , most of the body parts seem *-1 to be metric , E_S
63518:21	and most of the engine parts seem *-1 to be S A E , E_S
63528:72	And of course , here \[ that , \+ that \] would involve * changing road signs all across the country , you know ,
63532:8	I thought 0 maybe they would convert to , uh , metric back when they went to the fifty-five mile an hour speed limit *T*-1 , because what is it *T*-2 fifty-six or fifty-seven 's \[ a hundred , \+ uh , \[ qua- , \+ \] a hundred \] kilometers , E_S
63532:15	I thought 0 maybe they would convert to , uh , metric back when they went to the fifty-five mile an hour speed limit *T*-1 , because what is it *T*-2 fifty-six or fifty-seven 's \[ a hundred , \+ uh , \[ qua- , \+ \] a hundred \] kilometers , E_S
63536:10	and you know N_S
63547:22	And , so . I do n't know , E_S
63549:34	and the other thing , too , is 0 , you know , between here and El Paso 's , what , five hundred miles , E_S
63550:30	but it 's almost eight hundred kilometers , you know . E_S
63551:12	That 'd sure seems like a long way . E_S
63551:15	That 'd sure seems like a long way . E_S
63554:32	but \[ they 'd need , \+ they 'd seem \] *-1 to be ticking off faster , too . E_S
63559:52	Every road sign 0 you come to *T*-1 , is like , well I do n't know 0 it that far . E_S
63561:44	Well they converted all the road signs to fifty-five miles an hour , you know , E_S
63565:8	I think 0 they , N_S
63577:10	You know , now cars , they have both . E_S
63578:72	Sooner or later they 'll start *-1 putting the miles on the inside and the kilometers in big numbers so people start *-2 thinking that way . E_S
63580:8	I know 0 the only other place that I was ever at *T*-1 where they really had it mixed *T*-2 \[ was , \+ was \] in Panama , where 's a lot of the road signs and everything are \[ in , \+ in \] miles per hour *T*-3 E_S
63582:20	And you got *-1 to know where you are *T*-2 because anything that *T*-3 was the old canal zone is going *-4 to be miles per hour , E_S
63593:58	and they 've got some great big bins there for newspaper , um , plastic , um , I think three bins for glass , white , green , and \[ whatev- , \+ whatever \] other combination there is *T*-1 . E_S
63596:24	\[ And , \+ and \] I think 0 they 've got \[ a comp- , \+ \] uh , some kind of container for aluminum . E_S
63624:49	\[ I , \+ I 'm \] \[ really going head , \+ you know , completely for it , \] E_S
63625:8	I think 0 it 's marvelous . E_S
63630:13	I do n't know \[ how , \+ how \] soon they 're going *-1 to do it *T*-4 , or how organized it 's going *-2 to be *T*-3 , E_S
63641:60	Well , down in the cafeteria do they have any place where you can put your , you know , pop cans , and things like that *T*-1 ? E_S
63669:46	And , they have , one , two , they have three , I think , that I know of *T*-1 for cans for people 0 *T*-2 have pop , E_S
63669:59	And , they have , one , two , they have three , I think , that I know of *T*-1 for cans for people 0 *T*-2 have pop , E_S
63683:10	and I think 0 it 's marvelous because , N_S
63690:10	And I think 0 they 're trying *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] make some changes . E_S
63702:36	The only thing 0 I \[ g- , \+ \] thought , um , that I have n't been trying *T*-1 , is when I , you know , go *-2 to take a shower *T*-4 , * to save the water , and to put it on my plants . Which I had never thought about *T*-3 before . E_S

63727:21	I 'm trying *-1 to think , E_S
63739:33	uh , one of the questions was , do you think 0 more *ICH*-2 should be done *-1 , or something else . E_S
63748:26	And it was only , I think , uh , forty cents more , you know , fifty cents more , E_S
63748:49	And it was only , I think , uh , forty cents more , you know , fifty cents more , E_S
63765:10	you know , and , for the environment \[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's , \] \+ there 's \] a good reason 0 * to do it *T*-1 , E_S
63768:29	Now , see that 's recycling , you know , E_S
63802:62	* talk about bottles the other day \[ on , uh , \+ on \] the radio station , I think 0 it 's K L T Y . They were talking about the , N_S
63803:8	I think 0 it 's in Canada 0 they 're using , oh , recyclable milk jugs , plastic milk jugs , as \[ a , \+ a \] reinforcement for roads . For road repairs *T*-1 . E_S
63817:10	You know they 're , N_S
63820:13	oh , I know , N_S
63822:10	You know , the old ones ?
63830:10	And I thought , well , that 's good . E_S
63843:18	Oh , I ca n't think of it now . E_S
63844:65	But \[ I was , \+ I was \] trying *-1 to get my , uh , kids , you know , to see different things that we could come up with *T*-2 for recycling purposes . E_S
63848:34	And just anything , 0 * to , you know , recycle *T*-1 rather than keep *-2 throwing *T*-1 it away , E_S
63857:13	Well , I think 0 \[ the , \+ the \] more 0 people are aware of it *T*-1 , \[ the , \+ the \] more they 'll do *T*-2 . E_S
63858:8	I think 0 that 's just the biggest problem is keeping it \[ in , \+ in \] front of the public so they understand how serious the problem is *T*-1 , and how important it *EXP*-3 is *T*-2 * to do that . E_S
63860:8	You know what I 'd like *-1 to see *T*-2 a little more . N_S
63880:13	I do n't think 0 I can keep my own garbage . E_S
63881:18	I mean , I might not have that much , E_S
63925:53	I got a woman in New Jersey the last time 0 I called *T*-1 , I think 0 *T*-2 . E_S
63953:16	So what do you think *T*-1 of the Texas weather ? E_S
63966:38	\[ \[ You , \+ you , \] \+ you \] know about August then . E_S
63976:68	A lot of people try *-1 to leave the state for a couple of weeks in August , for , you know , N_S

63998:41	It is so cool , 0 you wear a jacket , you know . E_S
64016:17	But it , you know , N_S
64038:18	I have *-1 to think every year *-4 to try *-5 to remember \[ what it was , \+ what 's it supposed \] *-2 to like *T*-3 this time of year . E_S
64043:47	Because March we usually get a lot of rain , in March , you know . E_S
64044:11	It 'll seem the news , the Harold Taft , you know , on the local news . E_S
64044:37	It 'll seem the news , the Harold Taft , you know , on the local news . E_S

64072:29	Well , it 's just that , you know , E_S
64074:36	In California you get these nice , lovely rains , you know , nothing really \[ down- , \+ you know , like downpours \] like 0 you have *T*-1 here . E_S

64095:8	I know ,

64099:40	And I go , gee , how did they form , you know , so perfect like that *T*-1 . E_S
64101:8	I think 0 that 's one of the \[ strange , \+ strange \] things , E_S
64106:24	I 've seen hail , you know , E_S

64116:13	\[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 that 's , N_S

64130:15	and then , I think , you know , 0 all that falling would warm it up and melt it , E_S
64130:25	and then , I think , you know , 0 all that falling would warm it up and melt it , E_S
64131:7	but maybe that 's what *T*-1 rounds it , I do n't know .
64131:42	but maybe that 's what *T*-1 rounds it , I do n't know .
64144:23	I said , Okay , you know E_S
64149:10	and I thought , ha ha , that 's Garland ,
64165:33	But I guess 0 you just tend *-1 to think \[ of , \+ of \] where your house is *T*-2 you know , and nothing else . E_S
64165:76	But I guess 0 you just tend *-1 to think \[ of , \+ of \] where your house is *T*-2 you know , and nothing else . E_S
64171:91	and close to that , what *T*-1 's called *-2 Duck Creek that *T*-3 runs through part of Garland , that 's the part that *T*-4 always seems *-5 to get hardest hit *-6 when \[ there 's , \+ there 's \] the hard rain *T*-7 . E_S
64176:52	and \[ a lot of houses , \+ a lot of houses \] around that creek seem \[ * to , \+ *-1 to \] get flooded *-2 E_S

64362:13	You do n't think 0 that 's strange looking . E_S

64433:8	I know 0 this sounds like a Texas story , E_S
64445:8	It may be eighty-two , because we bought our house in eighty-one E_S
64468:45	And even every once in a while I put it on myself , you know . E_S
64491:88	Though \[ I , \+ I \] could n't tell you anything about them other than when my wife says , This is Bach *T*-1 , you know . E_S
64498:27	Well , \[ I , \+ you know , \[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] \] know all that much myself , E_S

64552:46	and the difference in the radio with popular music , is totally different , you know , E_S
64561:35	because Baltimore will play more , uh , what *T*-1 might be considered *-2 \[ m- , \+ a little bit more \] progressive ? E_S

65564:14	And , you know , and then * to go into Baltimore , I mean , \[ it \+ well , it 's \] fewer miles , E_S
65594:16	You just ca n't believe all the things 0 he 's done *T*-1 . E_S
65600:7	So maybe I will *?* . E_S
65607:13	I 'm not sure . E_S
65608:13	I do n't know . E_S
65609:21	I 'm trying *-1 to think of the guy 's name . E_S
65618:50	Uh , I was listening to something on the radio about , uh , you know , a talk show about sports books , E_S
65628:11	I 'm sure 0 he 'd like it . E_S
65631:20	And , uh , I was thinking about , N_S
65661:64	I mean , they 're talking about , uh , * having it , uh , as a , you know , business . Uh , \[ \[ * to , \+ uh , you know , * to , \] \+ so , \] \[ the , \+ you know , the \] government does n't have *-1 to deal with it . E_S

65666:11	because I think 0 it 's all funded , either state or federally funded E_S
65671:101	\[ \[ So , \+ but , \] \+ uh , But \] see \[ \[ they 're , \+ they do n't have enough , \] \+ uh , uh , you know , \[ there 's , \+ there 's \] not enough \] room in these prisons \[ and that , \+ and that , \] uh , * to continue *-1 funding it . E_S
65675:8	They think 0 they need *-1 to , maybe have , uh , you know , \[ private , you know , business , \+ private enterprise \] come in . E_S
65675:30	They think 0 they need *-1 to , maybe have , uh , you know , \[ private , you know , business , \+ private enterprise \] come in . E_S

65678:32	Well , see the other way 0 I 'm thinking about *T*-1 is 0 they should be self-supporting , like , uh , the prisoners make license plates or farm or small industry inside the prisons . Anything to where they can be self-supporting within themselves *T*-2 . E_S
65690:32	So it 's \[ self defen- , \+ you know , self-defense \] on that point . E_S
65702:66	it *EXP*-1 's tough * \[ to , \+ to \] say \[ what , \+ uh , you know , what , \] uh , N_S
65714:8	I know what you are saying *T*-1 . E_S
65715:50	But I 'm just saying that even the differences , uh , is that , you know , some countries pay for students to go \[ to , \+ through \] college and etcetera . E_S
65716:29	But here , \[ it , \+ you know , it 's \] just up to high school . E_S
65721:30	Just * doing it , which I think *T*-3 would bring the education back up . You know , N_S
65721:60	Just * doing it , which I think *T*-3 would bring the education back up . You know , N_S
65725:86	why * not an apprentice out to \[ a , \+ a \] company and learn from down on the bottom as a wood worker or , you know , just a technician *T*-1 ? E_S
65738:8	I think 0 \[ the pro- , \+ you know , that 's \] one reason , 0 uh , you know , we do have the education *T*-1 is that what it *EXP*-3 takes *T*-2 for these companies to bring somebody on board .

65739:44	Uh , E_S they 're not willing * \[ to , \+ you know , to \] put \[ that , \+ you know , the training \] for only a certain amount . E_S

65742:27	So , uh , it 's , you know , as far as the technical side . N_S
65746:53	But they ca n't just bring somebody in without *-1 even having gone to , you know , school in that area before they can work , you know , for a lawyer as a paralegal . E_S

65754:64	\[ \[ \[ I , \+ I 'm , \] \+ well ya- , I , \] \+ you know , I 'm \] assuming that it can be done *-1 .
65755:30	Uh , E_S my perspective is that , you know , I 've been with a couple of big companies now . E_S
65757:10	You know , they want somebody *ICH*-3 , you know , \[ when they then , \+ when they \] \[ bring them off , \+ bring them in *T*-1 , \] that *T*-2 they have something , you know , a certain amount 0 * to contribute *T*-4 . E_S

65810:8	I think , 0 I just heard something the other day , E_S

65832:13	Well , it seems to me that kids that *T*-1 \[ a- , \+ \] get out of high school that parents *T*-4 have gone to college and college here and college there that *T*-2 are really not interested in *-3 going to college and forced *-3 into it , usually are your drop outs .
65844:49	Well , \[ as \+ as \] far as \[ the , \+ you know , the \] deficit , that 's a whole nother , uh ,

65862:8	I think , uh , N_S
65868:10	You know , they always offer credit cards for college students . E_S

65904:63	\[ I 've got , \+ I 've got \] two \[ that I , \+ you know , that \] usually I 'll have a balance on *T*-1 . E_S

65916:38	But I do n't have *-1 to worry about , you know , *-3 running them up *-2 too high , except at Christmas . E_S
65933:10	And it seems like every time 0 I 'm short of cash *T*-2 , I just go *-1 \[ get , \+ get \] it from Visa . E_S
65948:74	Or if they 've sent you \[ a , \+ uh , a \] number that you can use *T*-1 . You know , \[ a , \+ a \] personal identification number that you can use *T*-2 in the , uh , impact machines or whatever , \[ you , \+ you \] can do that . E_S
65956:10	You know , sometimes you have *-1 to ask them for that . E_S
65968:39	and then we got , uh , a bill saying , you know , uh , 0 the yearly fee , it was like forty dollars . E_S
65978:10	So I thought , man , I do n't know if I trust this or not . E_S
65978:29	So I thought , man , I do n't know if I trust this or not . E_S
66000:15	Well , you know , the way 0 the economy 's going *T*-1 and inflation and the recession and all that , I think 0 \[ we , \+ we \] really need *-2 to try *-3 to stay out of debt as much as possible . E_S

66004:8	I know it . E_S

66066:49	and you really have *-1 to watch \[ it , \+ \] this you know . E_S
66075:62	Because \[ every , \+ every \] month all of these credit cards report to the credit bureau , you know . Automatically ,
66082:48	\[ it 's \+ \] bad because if \[ you , \+ you know , your \] bill is due on the fifteenth then \[ i- , \+ \] \[ \[ \[ \[ y- , \+ y- , \] \+ y- , \] \+ you- , \] \+ you 're \] not past due until the fifteenth of the next month . E_S

66110:15	Well , you know , \[ you , \+ you \] can do that . E_S
66111:8	I believe 0 it costs about ten dollars . E_S
66118:8	You might even find 0 somebody 's been reporting on you E_S
66119:18	and you did n't even know it . E_S
66120:10	You know , \[ you , \+ I mean you \] might think 0 you 're paying something on time E_S

66129:54	Or something 0 you have n't paid *T*-1 in sixty days or ninety days , you know . And things like that . N_S
66131:8	I think that Discover Card has a good idea with , you know , * giving you a little cash back incentive for each amount 0 \[ you , \+ you \] purchase *T*-1 . As long as you do n't go crazy *-2 trying *-3 to get cash back . E_S
66131:40	I think that Discover Card has a good idea with , you know , * giving you a little cash back incentive for each amount 0 \[ you , \+ you \] purchase *T*-1 . As long as you do n't go crazy *-2 trying *-3 to get cash back . E_S
66139:13	I do n't know . E_S
66151:11	I would think 0 it would n't be , you know , much more than the eighteen or nineteen percent 0 everyone else charges *T*-1 . E_S
66151:36	I would think 0 it would n't be , you know , much more than the eighteen or nineteen percent 0 everyone else charges *T*-1 . E_S
66159:8	I know ,
66165:47	And , uh , when I did *T*-1 , \[ I , \+ you know , I \] realized \[ that , \+ that \] it just \[ looked , \+ seemed \] like I was never paying the balance off , you know . E_S
66165:98	And , uh , when I did *T*-1 , \[ I , \+ you know , I \] realized \[ that , \+ that \] it just \[ looked , \+ seemed \] like I was never paying the balance off , you know . E_S

66190:45	So anyway , they ca n't bill you any higher than eighteen percent , I think , \[ in , \+ in \] Texas . E_S
66204:21	I was trying *-1 to think if there was anything else . E_S
66228:32	So \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] probably the worst thing 0 I 've ever had *T*-1 happen with a credit card . E_S
66235:13	* Does n't seem like it 's being carried *-1 out very well in my opinion . E_S
66239:8	it seems like they could die of old age *-1 waiting *-2 to get the death penalty . E_S
66244:8	I know what you mean *T*-1 . E_S
66258:125	I saw a statistic *ICH*-2 just a few days ago , um , 0 so far this \[ ye- , \+ year , \] or was it during the last year , \[ somewh- , \+ during \] a year 's time , I think 0 it was they executed twenty-five people in the nation . E_S
66263:26	and it 's building up , you know , E_S
66272:26	And , uh , here in Maryland I know 0 *T*-1 we have a real problem with overcrowding in prisons ,
66302:14	Uh , \[ may , \+ \] it may not have been Maryland . E_S
66302:28	Uh , \[ may , \+ \] it may not have been Maryland . E_S
66303:8	It may have been Massachusetts , E_S
66308:28	Anyway , well the question is , you know , do you think , 0 \[ i- , \+ it \] does make a difference in whether or not a criminal commits a crime E_S or do you think 0 it can *?* if it 's done *-1 right ? E_S
66308:40	Anyway , well the question is , you know , do you think , 0 \[ i- , \+ it \] does make a difference in whether or not a criminal commits a crime E_S or do you think 0 it can *?* if it 's done *-1 right ? E_S
66308:113	Anyway , well the question is , you know , do you think , 0 \[ i- , \+ it \] does make a difference in whether or not a criminal commits a crime E_S or do you think 0 it can *?* if it 's done *-1 right ? E_S
66310:18	Um , \[ I think \+ \[ if they , \+ if they \] started *-1 executing them on a regular basis , uh , \[ that \+ \] I think \] 0 it might make a difference . E_S
66310:96	Um , \[ I think \+ \[ if they , \+ if they \] started *-1 executing them on a regular basis , uh , \[ that \+ \] I think \] 0 it might make a difference . E_S
66310:109	Um , \[ I think \+ \[ if they , \+ if they \] started *-1 executing them on a regular basis , uh , \[ that \+ \] I think \] 0 it might make a difference . E_S
66323:11	Well I think 0 in large measure the reason 0 they do n't care *T*-1 , N_S
66323:23	Well I think 0 in large measure the reason 0 they do n't care *T*-1 , N_S
66332:22	and so , uh , you know , \[ their , \+ their \] success rate is very high . E_S
66340:20	and of course , you know , \[ they 're , \+ they 're \] playing it up *-1 real big that it \[ was , \+ \] looked like it was a very , very small ring E_S
66346:8	I think 0 they 've got over a hundred dead already this year . E_S
66352:90	and you have *-1 to remember that \[ \[ \[ it , \+ it , \] \+ it , \] \+ uh , there 's , \] I think , X number of people out there that *T*-2 are going *-3 to commit murders , E_S
66363:44	the only consolation is 0 so many of the murders are , you know , N_S the , the violent people going against each other E_S
66364:20	and so they , you know , N_S
66366:13	well at least maybe the guy 0 they cross *T*-1 next time is going *-2 to *?* .
66367:20	Uh , N_S \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 capital punishment is an appropriate punishment for the kind of people where we say , you know , this sort of person is just not acceptable to our society *T*-1 E_S

66372:36	I mean , \[ I , \+ I \] personally think 0 life imprisonment , E_S
66373:13	I do n't think much \[ of li- , \+ of life \] imprisonment .

68157:13	I do n't think 0 they 're shoddy ,
68159:13	Electrical appliances I think 0 *T*-1 are pretty good , \[ r- , \+ reliable . \] E_S
68176:13	I did n't think that it heated well enough . E_S
68200:10	but I think 0 it was the store . E_S
68220:22	That was poor quality , I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
68222:8	I think 0 it is *?* too , E_S
68233:19	that 's what I think *T*-1 too . E_S
68234:50	And one \[ \[ belt loop , \+ the wo- , \] \+ uh , you know , like the \[ chain link , \+ chain belt \] loop \] half of it raveled out . E_S
68238:20	And that was , I believe a Leslie Faye dress E_S
68239:20	and it was , I think , over a hundred dollars . E_S
68249:11	But I think 0 it should have been better than that , for that money , is what I mean *T*-1 . E_S
68252:11	Well I believe that we 've been talking about five minutes . E_S
68255:8	I think so . E_S
68276:22	Uh , well then you must know a lot more about this than I do . E_S
68278:18	Uh , \[ I think , \+ I think , 0 \] uh , \[ s- , \+ the system \] right now , you know , \[ should , \+ you know , is \] fine . E_S

68278:100	Uh , \[ I think , \+ I think , 0 \] uh , \[ s- , \+ the system \] right now , you know , \[ should , \+ you know , is \] fine . E_S
68279:8	I think 0 it should be by a jury . E_S
68280:13	I do n't think 0 the judge should have
68286:42	Uh , \[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] even think that it should be unanimous either . Uh , E_S
68289:8	I thought 0 that was the point of , uh , a unanimous jury was the idea that if everyone agrees then there should n't be any reasonable doubt . E_S
68296:71	But , if there are some people who *T*-1 do n't agree uh , \[ then there must be , \+ it seems *-2 to be 0 there must be \] at least a reasonable doubt for some people . E_S
68302:18	Uh , I do n't know . E_S
68305:64	but , uh , more than likely the people that *T*-1 are on \[ the , \+ the \] jury know what they 're doing *T*-2 . E_S
68315:50	They say 0 they 're , uh , remarkably incompetent . And , uh , do n't know what they 're doing *T*-1 and say one thing in the courtroom
68319:16	Well , you would think that they would get that in the , uh , N_S
68320:39	when the prosecution and defense are choosing the jury *T*-1 you would think that *T*-2 those would come out E_S
68321:25	and \[ I , \+ I \] know 0 they automatically , N_S
68328:57	MUMBLEx , they do n't want \[ anyone with exper- , \+ anyone with particular experience \] or knowledge of the legal system . E_S
68339:20	I mean , you know , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] anyone *ICH*-1 can get out of jury just about , N_S
68346:69	\[ I 'd be , \+ I mean I 'd be \] tried *-1 by a jury of , you know , people who *T*-2 had nothing else 0 *-3 to do *T*-4 and were n't very knowledgeable about certain sorts of things , E_S

68359:32	and \[ apparently I , \+ apparently \] they thought 0 I served E_S
68366:15	so I 'm pretty sure 0 I did n't . E_S
68370:33	\[ I , \+ uh , I \] do n't know , E_S
68371:13	\[ I think 0 the , \+ I guess 0 there 's \] a lot of problems with the legal system . E_S
68374:48	well , \[ \[ I \+ , I , \] \+ I \] do n't know , E_S
68375:63	I definitely feel like we need *-1 to keep it at least unanimous E_S because , uh , you know , there 's the classic sort of * TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD kind of story where you get , you know , jury which *T*-2 can have all kinds of prejudices and things that , a judge at least officially is n't supposed *-3 to have *T*-4 .

68382:17	And , uh , it seems to me that if you could just have a simple majority or something you could pretty much \[ brow- , \+ you know , browbeat \] the jury , \[ a majority , \[ in the , \+ of the , \] \+ a majority of the \] jury , E_S

69088:22	but , um , I do n't know . E_S
69089:8	I know a girl that ,

69104:10	Do you think that it 's right ? E_S
69111:25	and \[ I , \+ I \] know the kind of cost 0 businesses go through *T*-1 in terms of accidents , on the job that *T*-2 are specifically drug and alcohol related , E_S
69119:82	Um , E_S and \[ th- , \+ the \] only way that they can prevent that *T*-1 \[ is , \+ is , \] you know , * making * sure that the employees are drug and alcohol free . E_S

69146:8	I think 0 they should be randomly drug tested *-1 . E_S
69150:8	I believe , full force in that . E_S
69154:13	I do n't know that I believe 0 every secretary in every company needs *-1 to be *?* *-2 . E_S
69154:23	I do n't know that I believe 0 every secretary in every company needs *-1 to be *?* *-2 . E_S
69158:10	You know , secretaries \[ are n't , \+ are n't \] really going *-1 to cost the company that much money if they fall face forward in their typewriter or something . E_S
69159:17	So , I do n't know . E_S
69171:46	Well , there , N_S it 's , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 one of the problems with it is 0 it affects a lot of other folks on the job if somebody else is impaired . E_S
69176:19	Because , MUMBLEx generally you know it . E_S

69194:14	and , you know , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] been the whole weekend since they 've done anything E_S
69197:10	You know , \[ that , \+ that 's \] kind of unfair , also . E_S
69220:13	And that 's probably the biggest problem 0 there is *T*-1 . E_S
69223:8	I think so ,
69225:10	And I know a lot of companies that *T*-1 will put you in an alcohol rehabilitation before they would put you in a drug rehab . E_S
69245:10	I , think 0 that 's fair . E_S
69251:8	I think 0 \[ the benef- , \+ the company benefits \] in the long run . E_S
69277:16	So that they 're sure that you have n't borrowed anybody 's , I guess , or something . E_S
69282:8	I know , E_S
69285:43	\[ I ca- , \+ it 's hard \] 0 * to believe *T*-1 , E_S
69293:8	I know . E_S
69325:32	and they can apparently test , um , back a certain period of time . Because MUMBLEx some of \[ the , \+ the \] residue ends up in your hair follicles , you know , E_S
69325:102	and they can apparently test , um , back a certain period of time . Because MUMBLEx some of \[ the , \+ the \] residue ends up in your hair follicles , you know , E_S
69328:13	I did n't know that . E_S
69358:19	I ca n't stand the thought of * giving blood . E_S
69402:40	Now how long in advance do they , uh , let them know *T*-1 ? E_S
69412:14	So they all know it . E_S
69415:17	and then , you know , arrangements *ICH*-3 are made *-1 like during the Summer for you know , um , food and \[ who *T*-4 's , \+ who *T*-2 's \] staying where , because a lot of people \[ fro- , \+ are from \] down here , in Texas . E_S
69415:57	and then , you know , arrangements *ICH*-3 are made *-1 like during the Summer for you know , um , food and \[ who *T*-4 's , \+ who *T*-2 's \] staying where , because a lot of people \[ fro- , \+ are from \] down here , in Texas . E_S
69436:19	and , uh , you know , there 's some my age E_S
69447:8	I think 0 if you can count on it every four years then people have it in mind E_S
69455:29	And so \[ it has , \+ it seems \] 0 by * doing it about six months ahead , they can pretty much get everybody there . E_S
69456:24	If they do n't , you know , they 'll say , oh we 're planning *-1 to \[ go \+ \[ so and so that , \+ \] go \] \[ to , \+ to \] a certain place that weekend with somebody else E_S
69456:118	If they do n't , you know , they 'll say , oh we 're planning *-1 to \[ go \+ \[ so and so that , \+ \] go \] \[ to , \+ to \] a certain place that weekend with somebody else E_S
69458:19	but six months ahead has seemed *-1 to be okay for them . E_S
69471:13	I have n't known many of those people , E_S

69527:13	I do n't know where , E_S
69535:29	it 's very pretty country in there I think 0 *T*-1 , E_S
69549:12	and do you think 0 you 'll have a baby 0 * to take *T*-1 back with you . E_S
69551:10	Uh , maybe , E_S
69552:13	I do n't know , E_S
69557:13	I do n't know , E_S
69558:4	probably . E_S
69560:31	I mean you need another milestone , you know . E_S
69568:14	well I 'm sure , E_S
69569:34	and \[ ha- , \+ then all of your family probably has \] not met your husband . E_S
69605:18	Well , I do n't know , uh , E_S
69623:18	well , um , I think 0 we have been talking probably about four and a half minutes . E_S
69623:37	well , um , I think 0 we have been talking probably about four and a half minutes . E_S
69627:61	And , uh , uh , we both look forward to * going to our next reunions , I 'm sure 0 *T*-1 . E_S
69637:7	And maybe I 'll talk to you again . E_S
69670:17	And , I do n't know if you 're familiar with California coastline , E_S
69715:10	And I think 0 we got the same thing in the forecast for the next two or three days . E_S
69816:10	You know , it 's not sandy like most of the state is *?* , E_S
69821:10	You know , once it rains a little bit , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] filled *-1 up
69826:8	you know . N_S
69855:13	so it would seem strange because in San Antonio , N_S
69860:64	And the water in Medina Lake and that area was really going down , that they were considering that they might have *-1 to do water rationing E_S
69861:10	and I thought oh , gee I 'm so glad *-2 to get out of there and get up here to the California Pacific coast where it rains *T*-1 and everything has flowers *T*-1 E_S
69863:51	And then I came here and found out 0 they were in the , you know , four year draught . E_S
69894:13	and then it seems sort of like a San Antonio early Winter or Fall , year-round . E_S
69898:10	So it seems like we only have two Springs \[ which *T*-1 is , \+ \] or two seasons E_S
69917:32	Um , we do a lot of , you know , N_S
69939:8	It seems like San Antonio is increasing in humidity over the years , E_S
69944:13	and it just seemed like every year it just got \[ more and more humid , \+ more and more humid . \]
69982:10	and we thought well , we 'll take advantage of it and see what all the Pacific coast is like *T*-1 . E_S
70004:46	But they 're so good about * clearing the roads , that , you know , it does n't usually bother you very much . E_S
70028:39	So , \[ they , \+ the people \] 0 I know *T*-1 that *T*-2 are from there , uh , they always miss it E_S
70030:8	Nothing seems quite as good . E_S
70041:13	but I 'm sure 0 it wo n't *?* . E_S
70047:14	Because we could sure use it . E_S
70048:13	Well , you think 0 that takes care of the time
70051:8	I think 0 that will do it . E_S
70054:13	Well , I sure appreciate *-2 hearing how things are going *T*-1 in Texas
70108:13	So , I think 0 you can end up *-1 doing more with them , it seems like *T*-2 . E_S

70121:8	you know , those basic tract \] houses ,
70126:17	but , uh , it seems like , though , for your area \[ that , \+ that \] is sort of different . E_S
70127:37	In a big city like that most houses , I would think 0 *T*-2 , would be sort of like what we live in *T*-1 . Just a you know , basic tract house . E_S
70127:92	In a big city like that most houses , I would think 0 *T*-2 , would be sort of like what we live in *T*-1 . Just a you know , basic tract house . E_S
70139:15	and uh , * seems like everyone that *T*-1 lives around us , ends up , you know , *-3 hearing every conversation that *T*-2 goes on outside with everyone . E_S
70139:58	and uh , * seems like everyone that *T*-1 lives around us , ends up , you know , *-3 hearing every conversation that *T*-2 goes on outside with everyone . E_S
70142:19	But , uh , you know , it 's fine for now , E_S
70145:10	You know , it *EXP*-1 's very difficult * to arrange furniture and things like that , E_S
70148:11	Because it seems like then , that they built the homes *-1 much larger E_S
70163:32	So \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] maybe not so typical , E_S
70176:10	you know , can you compare yourself to any thing around there . E_S
70188:21	I mean , I got probably the biggest , E_S
70196:14	But , you know , too , the only bad thing , too , is that then you have *-1 to keep up , you know , N_S
70196:76	But , you know , too , the only bad thing , too , is that then you have *-1 to keep up , you know , N_S
70209:10	and it seems like N_S
70211:45	I almost wish 0 I was in an apartment or something . You know , E_S
70216:23	Well , um , I do n't know ,
70218:31	or do you have *-1 to talk for a certain amount of time ? E_S
70219:10	Do you know ? E_S
70231:29	I mean , do people around that area seem *-1 to do a lot of renovation ? E_S
70241:46	\[ the typical , \+ the typical \] homes there are like , you know , early nineteen hundreds late eighteen hundreds , E_S
70247:80	I mean , there , if you do n't live in a house that *T*-1 's at least seventy-five to hundred years old , you know , you 're just nobody , practically . E_S
70250:87	So , uh , it *EXP*-3 was quite a change for me to come to a house like that *ICH*-2 now that *T*-1 's just , you know , a very square little box E_S
70251:14	and , you know , there 's not a whole lot 0 you can do *T*-1 with it . E_S
70262:39	Well , I have lived in a small town for , you know , N_S
70265:14	And , you know , I did n't move out of there until I was , you know , twenty-seven E_S
70265:56	And , you know , I did n't move out of there until I was , you know , twenty-seven E_S
70266:23	and that was just , you know , N_S
70268:10	You know , I had lived in a rural area \[ for , \+ for \] so long E_S
70294:14	or , you know , I usually have gotten flowers coming out the gazoo , E_S
70297:19	So , uh , you know , I 'm just kind of \[ trying * to , \+ trying *-1 to \] stick in with that , E_S
70301:34	but , uh , since that 's over with now , maybe \[ I can , \+ I can \] get this yard in shape . E_S
70316:15	I 'm not real sure what they 're going *-1 to do *T*-2 this year . E_S
70319:35	I do plant a lot of beans , because it seems like , the , uh , bugs get on them so easily E_S
70322:19	I water , you know , spray the plants , because they say , 0 supposedly , that will keep the bugs off them . E_S
70354:11	you could probably do that . E_S
70360:11	I would think so if you only have one bathroom for three bedrooms , E_S
70379:37	That could account for a lot of marital problems . I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
70382:18	You get *-1 to know each other very well if you have *-2 to share a bathroom . E_S
70402:20	Oh , so he does n't know , right . E_S
70428:11	So you think that you want *-1 to move away from the big city , uh ? E_S
70446:22	So it 's not , you know , N_S
70488:49	and so , what we did *T*-1 was draw up a budget that we thought , uh , 0 *T*-2 was realistic . E_S
70529:72	and we really , uh , lessened \[ it , \+ uh , our living expenses , \] uh , more than what we thought 0 we would *?* *T*-1 . E_S
70547:61	so , but we 've had budgets that *T*-1 did n't work when our , uh , you know , N_S
70564:130	and we started out without kids , of course , and found it *EXP*-1 much easier * to save and used *-2 to do a lot , more fun kinds of of things and , uh , did really , um , you know , have a real strict \[ budg- , \+ but , budget \] E_S
70569:23	and we were just , you know , dirt poor . E_S
70571:165	So , we virtually did that for about two years , which *T*-1 worked real well , and then moved from California where we realized 0 we could never buy a house anyway no matter how much we saved *T*-2 *T*-6 , and moved to Texas , bought a house *ICH*-5 immediately , you know , which *T*-3 , of course , is now devalued *-4 with the housing market , E_S
70578:17	so , I do n't know if \[ we , \+ we \] did a good thing * to buy a house *T*-1 or not E_S
70592:13	I do n't know , E_S
70594:43	we 've done like a survey of like * taking , you know , the past three months of where all the money went *T*-1 . E_S
70599:10	but it seems like there 's , um , times when we just have *-1 to get out *T*-3 where we 'll go and like get a baby-sitter and we 'll go and we 'll blow , you know , fifty , sixty dollars in one night * going out *-2 to eat , going to a show or doing something *T*-4 , you know . E_S
70599:124	but it seems like there 's , um , times when we just have *-1 to get out *T*-3 where we 'll go and like get a baby-sitter and we 'll go and we 'll blow , you know , fifty , sixty dollars in one night * going out *-2 to eat , going to a show or doing something *T*-4 , you know . E_S

70601:13	Well , I think 0 that 's important for your budget * to be realis- , N_S
70605:102	that 's the hard part because when we sit down *-1 to make it *T*-2 , we try *-3 to make it real spartan and real narrow so we can put a certain amount in savings every week E_S
70607:61	because we do find that we want *-1 to go and do something or splurge for , you know , birthday for somebody E_S
70608:14	or , you know , \[ even we , \+ we even \] do things real frugally for the kids , E_S
70609:59	we get a lot of toys and clothes and stuff at garage sales or from friends because they do n't know the difference at this age , you know , whether they 're JORDACHE new or whether they 're , you know , something E_S
70609:82	we get a lot of toys and clothes and stuff at garage sales or from friends because they do n't know the difference at this age , you know , whether they 're JORDACHE new or whether they 're , you know , something E_S

70615:67	so . But , um , that 's the hardest part for us is that it 's really , um , you know , budgeting and some extra things , you know , \[ for- , \+ \] that *T*-1 are more , you know , nonessential items . E_S
70615:93	so . But , um , that 's the hardest part for us is that it 's really , um , you know , budgeting and some extra things , you know , \[ for- , \+ \] that *T*-1 are more , you know , nonessential items . E_S

70617:112	Well , I found , uh , that , in the place that it was harder for me to stick to a budget *T*-6 was not where we were concerned *-5 *T*-2 , but where maybe our friends *ICH*-1 were concerned *-4 and our relatives and parents *T*-3 . E_S
70631:13	And I really believe that if you 're going *-1 to cut down on yourself , you need *-2 to cut down somewhat on your friends . E_S
70636:46	Well , we have so many unexpected things come * up so often it seems 0 *T*-1 with , N_S
70638:61	and something will come up and wind up * having *-1 to spend a thousand dollars , you know , on the car in two months or something , E_S
70642:14	and , you know , a lot of things like that that really \[ ar- , \+ are \] hard 0 * to plan for *T*-1 . E_S
70646:8	I think 0 you have *-1 to budget those things though . E_S
70649:22	* kind of put in a certain amount per year , E_S
70665:62	our biggest way of * saving money is then * to stop all these deductions , um , you know , is * to , N_S
70669:31	and then we get more money back , you know , at the end of the year , E_S
70705:116	\[ so . \+ But \] we 're trying *-1 to put a little money away for the kids because we can \[ en- , \+ envision \] the , uh , expenses for college already , you know , eighteen years away or whatever . E_S
70733:13	Oh , I know E_S
70747:13	I 'm not sure *ICH*-1 , though , whether I feel , N_S
70748:21	I guess 0 I am sure that I feel that , in general , though , uh , the allocation , uh , of the taxes in certain areas , \[ i- , \+ is n't \] correct . E_S

70750:16	Well , I 'm sure that , uh , probably every person in this country would agree with you on that . Because everybody has a different idea of where the money should go *T*-1 . E_S
70750:32	Well , I 'm sure that , uh , probably every person in this country would agree with you on that . Because everybody has a different idea of where the money should go *T*-1 . E_S
70757:17	and I 'm not really sure \[ that , \+ that \] we 've gotten our money 's worth there , uh , regardless of the outcome of the Desert Storm , uh , Desert Shield , uh , situations . E_S
70764:166	Uh , I guess 0 my particular beef is that * having participated in the \[ mi- , \+ military \] off and on \[ over the , \+ over the \] years of *-2 being called *-1 back and things of that nature , is , uh , I 've found that , you know , there 's an extraordinary amount of waste . E_S
70774:135	why \[ \[ I , \+ I 'm , \] \+ I 'm \] a little concerned about *T*-2 today is that this , uh , \[ rather , uh , quick \[ and , \+ and \] easy , \+ I do n't know , I should n't say easy , rather quick \] victory \[ in the , \+ \[ in , \+ in \] the , \] uh , Mideast , uh , uh , over the , uh , Iraqis , uh , might lead us into , uh , a false sense *ICH*-1 of security that we can do that against any other foe .

70801:28	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't know \[ what amount of , \+ what amount of , \] our hardware *T*-1 would stop some fanatic , I guess , from *-2 doing anything , uh , that *T*-3 would be irrational . E_S
70832:13	I do n't know , E_S

70841:43	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] do n't know ,
70850:105	basically , what it does *T*-1 , is it takes extra money from the more affluent school districts , \[ that *T*-2 are , \+ that *T*-3 \[ are , \+ you know come \] \] from local taxes and send them to other parts of the state , that *T*-4 are not so affluent . E_S

70913:13	I do n't think 0 I would have gone on , unless I had that financial uh , easement made *-1 possible . E_S
70921:16	I do n't even know if you have *-1 to perform community service , E_S

70965:21	Oh , oh , I can believe that . E_S
70967:33	\[ But , \+ but , \] I 'm not too sure 0 when I put my property tax *ICH*-1 in , my car tax , my income tax , and these myriad of , uh , N_S
70973:13	I 'm not sure that I 'm not up fairly close to that . E_S
70977:11	You really think so ? E_S
71081:46	\[ It , \+ well , it 's \] always something that *T*-1 seems so odd to me E_S
71111:13	well , I think 0 it sounds good . E_S
71117:10	but I know people who *T*-1 do it \[ and , \+ and \] enjoy it very much . E_S
71119:20	Well , and actually , I think that most women 's garden clubs that I 've been aware of *T*-1 in the past , uh , are only flowers , E_S
71139:53	Well , um , there are n't men 's gardening clubs *ICH*-2 in this area that I know of *T*-1 , E_S
71141:52	\[ But , \+ um , and \] usually they 're the tea type things , you know , where they have a little luncheon *T*-1 E_S
71151:8	I think so too . E_S
71192:10	you know , but they 're not quite E_S
71194:27	Um , and , of course , you know , \[ the , \+ \] mine are old theory ordinary flowers , marigolds \[ and , \+ and \] that sort of thing . E_S
71207:13	I do n't know , E_S
71208:5	maybe this climate is a little better . E_S
71222:13	Well , you know why ,
71228:40	\[ she alw- , \+ she always \] grows , you know , five different varieties , E_S
71235:13	well , I think 0 it has the best flavor . E_S
71253:21	The flavor is better I think 0 *T*-2 in between . E_S
71267:20	Well , my mother does n't think 0 they have any flavor the way 0 I cook them *T*-1 . E_S
71269:15	Well , and I know 0 I love them , E_S
71271:10	But I think , 0 that 's like another vegetable . E_S
71302:25	And I have four children , you know , E_S
71316:52	and I suppose 0 that 's why I enjoy gardening *T*-1 , because , you know , * growing up with it . E_S
71318:8	I think so too . E_S
71357:13	I do n't know if you have had that problem there or not . E_S
71361:28	But \[ it 's , \+ you know , it 's \] a problem \[ that *T*-1 's , \+ that *T*-2 's \] moving south \[ from , \+ from \] the New England area . E_S
71373:41	So , that 's the same technique that *T*-1 is , you know , for any of the other , uh , little varmints that *T*-2 get in vegetables E_S
71404:10	you know , * rains a little too often . E_S
71408:13	Oh , I think so , E_S
71428:53	\[ It 's , \+ uh , it 's \] a new , uh , form I think 0 *T*-1 , E_S
71448:8	I probably could n't do that because of my knee . E_S
71477:25	but , as far as , you know , uh , N_S
71514:42	It 's , um , like isolated movements for \[ each muscle \+ certain muscles groups , \] E_S
71523:25	\[ you can do it with certain , \+ you know , you can do it with weights \] if you wanted *-1 to *?* E_S
71523:38	\[ you can do it with certain , \+ you know , you can do it with weights \] if you wanted *-1 to *?* E_S

71531:13	Um , I know 0 I 'm looking forward to *-1 getting back into *-2 getting into shape , E_S
71533:100	but I feel guilty for *-1 not going , because \[ \[ I \+ really I 'm , \] \+ I 'm \] so used to *-2 going for , you know , three or four years now . E_S
71547:14	and , you know , * working out six hours a day , usually six or seven days a week that kind of , kept us all in pretty good shape , . E_S
71554:57	But , uh , \[ ever , \+ ever \] since I got out of school , you know , * just jumped right into the job E_S
71569:31	I walk a lot because , uh , you know , *-1 being \[ in , \+ in \] school we , N_S
71573:13	I do n't know if your campus was anything like ours , E_S

71655:21	I 'm trying *-1 to think \[ of , \+ of \] other things that I do *T*-2 that *T*-4 will be considered *-3 exercise , , E_S
71660:8	I know 0 it ju- , N_S
71664:53	well , when we were at this junior college *T*-1 , uh , our coach , you know , N_S
71686:25	and she 'd , uh , you know , N_S
71688:37	so she 'd kind of lay it on occasionally , you know , . E_S
71692:21	First at eight , I think 0 *T*-1 we had N_S
71704:13	I do n't know , if you 've seen them , E_S
71710:8	I think 0 my wife has some . E_S
71728:32	Uh , \[ there 's like , \+ I know 0 there 's \] purple , gray , and , uh , green . E_S

71735:13	Uh , I think , uh , 0 with the aerobic classes you have *-1 to get an instructor that *T*-2 's fun . E_S
71757:35	oh , I could never do that I do n't think , . E_S
71768:51	I mean , \[ \[ they , \+ they , \] \+ they \] really know how *-2 to isolate each of the different muscle groups , with those things *T*-1 E_S
71773:13	I do n't know E_S
71795:39	I just use the regular machines and the free weights , you know , like little five pound hand weights and eight pound hand weights . E_S
71799:24	Just * to do , you know , some bicep , tricep exercises . E_S
71810:8	I think 0 that 's , uh , number one problem with everyone . E_S
71814:37	\[ I 'm , \+ I \] guess 0 I probably put on about \[ ten , \+ nine or ten \] pounds , since I stopped *-2 playing , which *T*-1 was about four years ago . E_S

71858:45	and \[ I , \+ I \] mean , I enjoyed , you know , N_S
71860:60	when I was playing ball *T*-1 we could like run all day and not be tired , you know . E_S
71870:18	Just that , you know , you do n't feel guilty when you eat that cake after dinner *T*-1 , . E_S
71896:31	\[ What , \+ what \] changes do you think 0 *T*-1 have taken *-2 place in the last generation ? E_S

71948:54	\[ \[ \[ it 's , \+ \] \+ and it 's , \] \+ I think 0 it 's \] kind of a new movement E_S

72057:5	maybe that 's contributed *-1 to a lot of the problems that we see *T*-2 all the time , E_S

72065:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think that , um , in the future , um , \[ the , \+ the \] family unit \[ as it , \+ as it \] once was known *-1 , \[ is , \+ is \] going *-2 to be nonexistent . E_S

72114:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think that eventually \[ the , \+ the \] family unit 's just not going *-1 to even exist anymore . E_S

72442:107	If someone says , do you want *-2 to do this tonight , uh , and I got a mountain of things 0 * to do *T*-1 , it 's okay , you know ,

72465:71	\[ e- , \+ even \] though I admire someone who *T*-1 is n't , like I am *?* , you know , \[ and , \+ and \] I wish 0 I could be more that way E_S

72605:10	do you know how * to use them in your life or to influence *T*-1 , N_S
72622:17	And , uh , I think 0 they 've all developed kind of an interest in reading also . E_S
72629:10	and I think 0 it 's important , E_S
72654:64	A lot of people that *T*-1 work for me that *T*-2 ca n't even spell or read , you know . E_S
72657:10	and I think that that 's why reading is so important *T*-1 , E_S
72661:18	because , uh , I think 0 even mentally when you can do some , N_S
72677:30	and had she not worked there I 'm not sure that I would have qualified . E_S
72688:16	Especially , you know , if you catch yourself *-2 short on cash or if you 're on vacation , it *EXP*-1 's just easier * to put everything on a card . E_S
72702:44	So , sometimes , uh , especially * traveling with T I , you know , everything goes on American Express , E_S
72719:46	we like *-1 to keep one on hand just for emergencies , you know . E_S
72739:94	\[ We keep them , \+ uh , we keep , \] uh , one gas card \[ and , \+ uh , and , \] uh , Visa just , you know , in case there 's an emergency or , something E_S
72758:22	and for some strange reason those people think 0 they need *-1 to get paid *-2 . E_S
72760:8	I know , E_S
72767:9	\[ maybe not , \+ maybe they 're not \] really concerned about *-1 getting paid E_S

72769:8	* know 0 if you do n't , then they 're adding on , what , eighteen , nineteen , twenty percent . E_S
72811:37	So , they 've got quite a bit more motivation I think 0 *T*-3 * to get paid *-2 then , some of the others do . E_S
72836:45	\[ and , \+ uh , but , \] \[ it , \+ you know , \[ you kind of , \+ you \] \] know that somebody every month , N_S

72840:14	and who *T*-3 knows how many people , *T*-2 are looking at those , uh , bills that *T*-1 come in , and those statements , E_S
72851:49	So , \[ yo- , \+ uh , you \] want *-1 to make * sure that , uh ,
72865:13	Citibank I think 0 *T*-1 is always sending the Visa stuff out . E_S
72873:10	You know you carry around a wallet full of credit cards , E_S
72891:78	Um , years ago , well , \[ th- , \+ \] I had my Visa card through this bank in Oklahoma City for , oh , probably fifteen years , E_S
72902:42	and I said , adios , \[ I 'm , \+ you know , I 'm \] not paying you , E_S
72908:49	\[ I mean , \+ I mean \] they get enough , you know , on the interest . E_S
72913:10	Well , sure . E_S
72948:8	I think 0 you 're right . E_S
72959:8	it sure does . E_S
72961:13	I do n't know . E_S
72986:8	I think 0 that may be the key word . E_S
72986:18	I think 0 that may be the key word . E_S
72988:8	I think 0 that 's correct . E_S
72990:8	It seems like , uh , even when they have consulted day care centers that *T*-1 are quote unquote reputable , that *T*-2 are sort of like a chain , if I can use that word *T*-4 uh , still you have *-3 to deal with the people that , you know , *T*-5 happen *-6 to be operating it locally E_S
72990:161	It seems like , uh , even when they have consulted day care centers that *T*-1 are quote unquote reputable , that *T*-2 are sort of like a chain , if I can use that word *T*-4 uh , still you have *-3 to deal with the people that , you know , *T*-5 happen *-6 to be operating it locally E_S
72994:57	and , uh , it 's just a matter \[ of , \+ of \] trust , you know , E_S
72995:8	I think 0 they feel that these people are , um , under qualified basically and underpaid *-1 , E_S
72996:10	and I think 0 that sort of goes hand in hand E_S
72999:13	Well , we certainly found that to be true . E_S
73032:11	I 'm sure 0 that 's true . E_S
73046:56	They had stayed with this family from the time 0 these children were small , you know , four or five years old *T*-1 , up until they were well into grade school . E_S
73048:17	and they , you know , had done such a good job . E_S
73049:39	So , um , I can see where someone , you know , in a position like that , in a live-in capacity , would definitely be the way 0 * to go *T*-1 if \[ you 're , \+ you 're \] lucky enough *-3 to have the financial MUMBLEx 0 * to be able *-2 to do that *T*-4 *T*-5 . E_S
73058:8	I think 0 it 's just a matter of priorities . E_S
73059:31	\[ It 's , \+ uh , you know , it 's \] a terrible thing 0 * to say *T*-2 when you 're speaking of children in that way *T*-1 , E_S
73060:42	but you still have *-1 to be realistic , as well , I think 0 *T*-2 . E_S
73075:19	but , uh , you know , it 's just , 0 there 's so much pressure when you 're talking about two people that *T*-1 work outside the home *T*-2 E_S
73075:50	but , uh , you know , it 's just , 0 there 's so much pressure when you 're talking about two people that *T*-1 work outside the home *T*-2 E_S
73076:24	\[ and , \+ and \] I think 0 that is one reason why I continue *-1 to be without children *T*-2 . E_S
73085:13	Well , it certainly is *?* . Uh , E_S
73105:10	Oh , sure . E_S
73112:25	There are those times when I think , gee , if I did n't have children I could be out *-1 playing bridge or golf *T*-2 . E_S
73118:14	But , you know , it 's funny . E_S
73119:55	\[ I did , \+ I had \] a friend that *T*-1 said , you know , before we always said 0 we do n't want children because we ca n't go off on the spur of the moment or this or that and the other E_S
73121:23	and she said , but you know , we never do those things anyway . E_S
73122:41	So \[ why \+ , why \] am I waiting , you know *T*-1 , E_S
73125:40	But the thing about the child care \[ I , \+ you know , I \] have friends that *T*-1 struggle financially
73127:41	It 's a matter *ICH*-2 not necessarily , uh , that she *ICH*-3 might want *-1 to stay home or he , as well , E_S
73128:14	but , you know , they need the money . E_S
73129:72	And , uh , when I seen some of my friends that *T*-1 have taken that six week old baby , you know , to someone else *T*-2 , it 's just , I can imagine how emotional it must be *T*-3 .
73130:37	\[ \[ And , \+ and , \] \+ \] you know , * multiplied *-4 by the fact that you do n't really trust the person or you 're uncomfortable with the situation MUMBLEx , as far as child care , um , E_S

73174:13	I do n't know , E_S
73175:8	I think 0 your patient level \[ must , \+ needs *-1 to \] increase as the child gets older . E_S

73220:11	I 'm sure . E_S
73225:25	But , we are helping , you know . E_S
73231:15	what *T*-1 's wrong with you ? E_S
73245:28	the stamina that you must , you know , draw *T*-1 from yourself *-2 to deal with it . E_S

73247:60	I guess 0 you find out that you 're a much stronger person than you thought *?* , maybe . E_S
73259:52	Now it 's just a reservoir that you tend to *T*-1 regularly , I 'm sure 0 *T*-2 . E_S

73340:28	And so they just sort of , you know , adopted me as their eleventh child E_S
73354:13	I do n't know . E_S
73368:21	And then you do n't really know what *T*-1 happened . E_S

73412:10	You know , I used *-1 to live up north . E_S
73413:21	Down here , Dallas , * seems to me , 0 the police are militant E_S
73437:45	In fact in the eight years 0 I 've been here *T*-1 it seems to me 0 it \[ gets more and more , \+ gets *-2 to be more and more \] restrictive place 0 * to live *T*-3 . I think , E_S

73472:10	you know I 'm no longer a teenager in high school . E_S

73500:14	that 's for sure . E_S
73516:10	you know , you just do n't buy a house , E_S

73734:13	Um , I think 0 life , uh , N_S

73756:8	I think 0 you 're right . E_S

73828:52	\[ it 's , \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] kind of hard * to really know because of N_S

73856:52	they 're different kind of dangers *ICH*-2 that *T*-1 face young people now and social pressures ,
73857:15	uh , E_S the pressures of drug is so much , E_S
73869:8	I think 0 that 's true , E_S
73870:8	I think 0 that 's true . E_S
73873:8	I think 0 the other thing is that , uh , we have taken some rather drastic turns \[ in our , \+ in our \] education and the way 0 we approach things *T*-1 as of maybe starting back \[ when , \+ when \] I 'm number one , you know , and , uh , uh , uh , * worrying about self and not , uh , seeing the consequences of the disintegration of the family *T*-2 .

73897:15	uh , you know , they 're constantly , excusing their , child E_S
73931:8	I think 0 a lot of , N_S it is the families , the way 0 you were mentioning *T*-1 , E_S
73939:8	I think that too . E_S

74122:8	I think 0 twenty , thirty years ago a lot of women , just did n't have *-1 to make that choice . E_S
74127:8	I think 0 that 's right . E_S

74161:20	Well , Kathleen , do you believe that there is a problem with our public school system ? E_S
74163:8	I certainly do . E_S
74164:18	Uh , \[ I think \+ ... I think \] 0 we have a lousy school system . E_S
74164:29	Uh , \[ I think \+ ... I think \] 0 we have a lousy school system . E_S
74166:16	And what do you think 0 that problem is *T*-1 ? E_S
74168:10	And I think 0 a lot of it has *-1 to do with the fact that we do n't train our teachers very well . E_S
74177:13	Huh . That seems like you 've thought this through quite a bit before . E_S
74177:26	Huh . That seems like you 've thought this through quite a bit before . E_S
74185:27	\[ And , \+ and \] I 'm sure 0 they 're colored *-1 by what I 've edited *T*-2 . E_S
74196:13	Well , I think 0 I would start \[ with a -bout , \+ with \] *-3 getting rid *-4 of about two-thirds of the administrators . And all the auxiliary personnel . The school bureaucracy that *T*-1 exists *-2 mainly to perpetuate itself . E_S
74203:157	And then I would \[ provide , \+ uh , use \] the money that we 've paying them *T*-1 *-4 to , uh , provide some special help in training and particularly , uh , mentor teachers 0 *T*-2 to work with the beginning teachers and the teachers who *T*-3 may have been at it a long time but have been making the same mistakes for a long time . E_S
74203:194	And then I would \[ provide , \+ uh , use \] the money that we 've paying them *T*-1 *-4 to , uh , provide some special help in training and particularly , uh , mentor teachers 0 *T*-2 to work with the beginning teachers and the teachers who *T*-3 may have been at it a long time but have been making the same mistakes for a long time . E_S
74211:89	And then * let them try some innovative things and see what *T*-2 works . And then , uh , have some sort of mechanism for * passing that knowledge along to other teachers who *T*-1 could benefit from the same sorts of things . And then from the parents ' side , have the parents support the school . Get involved . E_S
74231:28	Oh , well . That I 'm not so sure about *T*-1 . E_S
74244:77	And , uh , that , basically , is the extent to which \[ our , \+ our \] family has been directly , you know , E_S
74256:32	The methods of * correcting it I have n't thought through *T*-1 quite to the detail which you have *?* *T*-2 . E_S
74257:10	But I believe that there 's definitely a basic perception and image problem with the fact of * even being a teacher . E_S
74262:28	And with that , of course , you know , you have *-1 to pay them \[ a , \+ \] accordingly . E_S
74269:8	I think 0 that 's absolutely right . E_S
74294:10	You know , if there 's some gauge that they could make *T*-1 . N_S
74298:43	Uh , also , \[ I 've alw- , \+ I 've \] thought \[ around \+ \] about the idea of * making teaching and the , N_S
74299:48	before you can get a certificate , you have \[ a , \+ a \] certain residency period . \[ So \+ \] much like a doctor . E_S
74301:10	But some certain type \[ of , \+ of \] position where you 're overseen *-1 *T*-2 * to begin with . E_S
74307:55	rather than * throw someone \[ in , \+ into \] that environment , uh , you know , it N_S
74310:18	\[ I do n't think 0 student , \+ I do n't think 0 student \] teaching is enough . E_S
74310:41	\[ I do n't think 0 student , \+ I do n't think 0 student \] teaching is enough . E_S
74312:8	I thought that maybe something . N_S
74312:15	I thought that maybe something . N_S
74314:8	I think that ,
74315:67	at least what I used *-2 to observe *T*-3 in student teaching , was that some college kid who *T*-1 might not be all that bright * to begin with , was thrown *-7 into a class room with a teacher who *T*-4 was harried and overworked and , uh , had too many kids 0 * to handle *T*-5 and too many things 0 * to do *T*-6 and too many interruptions * to pay much attention to the student teacher . E_S
74350:14	And , you know , the whole electronic classroom idea . E_S
74353:13	I do n't know if I I 'm \[ in favor \+ yeah , in favor \] of , yeah , N_S
74355:13	I do n't think 0 that 's going *-1 to work . E_S
74357:8	I think , 0 especially in the younger years you need *-1 to have more of \[ the , \+ the \] person contact rather than just the fact that your machine being fed *-2 information 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] learn how * to learn *T*-3 *T*-4 . E_S
74360:24	Well , another thing 0 I think 0 *T*-1 would be helpful would be * to have some sort \[ of , \+ of \] say a national curriculum . Because one of the problems with * getting good textbooks is that we have such a fragmented system for , uh , curriculums that the textbook makers produce a textbook that *T*-2 will sell in Texas and California . E_S
74384:14	And , you know , a third of the Texas market with its millions of kids is a heck of a lot of textbooks . E_S
74404:17	And I hope 0 maybe we 're going *-1 to get somewhere with a little more attention being paid *-2 to it with , uh , Reagan 's , uh , new education secretary \[ and , \+ \] uh , you know , \[ trying * to do some , \+ uh , trying *-3 to produce some \] new programs anyway . E_S

74442:18	Oh , I would n't know , E_S
74443:8	I measured it one time , because \[ I was , \+ \] uh , we had saw some termites E_S
74447:10	and we thought about *-2 getting it sprayed *-1 . E_S
74448:8	I think 0 it was like , N_S
74459:17	We kind of need maybe one more room . E_S
74550:40	Where you 've got *-1 to leave the furniture just one certain way *T*-2 , you ca n't rearrange it at all . E_S
74554:8	I know what you 're saying *T*-1 there , E_S
74560:10	You know we have windows in our bathrooms which *T*-1 really makes it difficult for , N_S
74585:39	and you ca n't really clean them on the inside , you know . E_S
74598:49	\[ it 's , \+ it 's \] seen some wear and tear . You know . E_S
74612:10	You know , well I mean , it 's not just horrible , E_S
74670:67	so if something breaks , we have *-1 to shut it off from the main , in the street , you know , E_S
74678:13	And we never know where it 's going *-1 to flood *T*-2 . E_S
74716:13	he did n't know what he was doing *T*-1 , E_S
74741:41	Well that 's the way 0 mine is *T*-1 , you know , E_S
74765:19	\[ your \+ \] husband probably knows . E_S
74765:22	\[ your \+ \] husband probably knows . E_S
74767:8	He probably knows , E_S
74767:11	He probably knows , E_S
74768:13	I do n't know what it is *T*-1 off hand . E_S
74772:25	Like I said , he did n't know what he was doing *T*-1 . E_S
74797:23	We have plastic , you know , just tied * down on everything , you know , as best 0 we could *?* , real thick edge stuff , I mean , E_S
74797:53	We have plastic , you know , just tied * down on everything , you know , as best 0 we could *?* , real thick edge stuff , I mean , E_S
74822:40	and I 'd turn on a light in the room , you know E_S
74836:13	I do n't know E_S
74858:8	you know that , E_S
74861:8	you might as well *?* E_S
74888:91	but they also ended up *-1 having *-2 to pay for the damage when the \[ re- , \+ \] roof was being repaired * *T*-4 . You know , which *T*-3 really was n't our fault . E_S
74894:69	I mean we 'd done everything 0 we could *?* *T*-2 *-1 to keep out the weather . You know , and stuff E_S
74943:8	It seems to me that one of the biggest differences is the computer revolution . E_S
74947:119	And , I can very clearly remember 0 ten years ago I was just beginning *-1 to explore *-2 computerizing my office \[ and , \+ and \] trying *-1 to find out what kinds of computers *T*-3 might be useful E_S
74958:13	Oh , I know it . E_S
74963:111	\[ I , \+ I 've \] seen that just in the last , uh , even five years *ICH*-2 how much they 've \[ in- , \+ uh , increased \] in use *T*-1 . Or probably eight years , E_S
74968:10	and it seemed like it would , N_S
74969:41	they were just getting out with \[ the , \+ you know , the \] disks and all that , getting away with the cards , you know , doing away with \[ the , \+ the \] programming cards E_S
74969:86	they were just getting out with \[ the , \+ you know , the \] disks and all that , getting away with the cards , you know , doing away with \[ the , \+ the \] programming cards E_S
74980:88	and we had *-1 to write code in binary E_S and , uh , have it punched *-2 in on those little cardboard cards which , I do n't think 0 *T*-3 exists anymore . E_S
74982:8	I know . E_S
74989:14	Uh , I think 0 T V has a lot 0 *T*-1 to do with the changes , too . Do n't you ?
74993:18	Uh , I 'm not sure 0 in the last ten years it 's been very different from before . E_S
74994:10	Uh , certainly in the last thirty I would say 0 *T*-1 there have been significant changes . \[ Even , \+ even \] the change from black and white to color television . E_S
74999:10	but I sure did n't have access to one . E_S
75004:13	and now I think 0 they 're \[ as , \+ almost as \] many , well , N_S
75022:8	I know . E_S
75046:8	I think 0 they just said the \[ changes in , \+ uh , \[ social , \+ social \] changes in \] the United States . E_S
75054:33	but ten years ago , uh , I do n't know . I 'd say , like *RNR*-1 in the nineteen seventies you remember how *T*-2 kids would walk around with A M , what do you call those *T*-3 , little A M radios *T*-4 E_S
75058:47	and now people have jam box with C D players in them , you know . And , hand held T V -s and car phones . E_S
75061:11	That 's certainly , a difference . E_S
75101:19	\[ Where do you think 0 it 's , \+ where do you think 0 it 's \] going *-1 to go *T*-2 in twenty years ? E_S

75104:14	I was just thinking , though , about 0 \[ a , \+ a \] huge social change in the last ten years is AIDS . E_S
75109:23	\[ I , \+ I \] know that because I was writing a paper about it . E_S
75114:27	Uh , and they still did n't even know what *T*-1 caused it or anything . E_S
75155:8	You think 0 that 's caused a lot of pressure *ICH*-1 on , like younger kids today , * to make choices that they probably should n't have *-2 to make *T*-3 ? E_S

75166:10	and I know that the expectation for them was , uh , * to have sex and , much earlier , than the expectation when I was in college *T*-1 . E_S
75173:57	In my day , we talked quietly behind our hands about people that we suspected 0 *T*-1 might be , sleeping with their boyfriends . E_S
75180:12	But , they certainly did n't expect everybody to *?* E_S
75185:10	And I certainly know from *-1 talking to my stepdaughter that girls in high school were under a whole lot more pressure nowadays . E_S
75185:13	And I certainly know from *-1 talking to my stepdaughter that girls in high school were under a whole lot more pressure nowadays . E_S
75185:66	And I certainly know from *-1 talking to my stepdaughter that girls in high school were under a whole lot more pressure nowadays . E_S
75188:27	It 's kind of scary when I think of what *T*-2 will happen in twenty years , you know , when I have kids and they 're grown *T*-3 and , uh , just kind of some of the changes that *T*-1 will happen even more *T*-4 E_S
75188:63	It 's kind of scary when I think of what *T*-2 will happen in twenty years , you know , when I have kids and they 're grown *T*-3 and , uh , just kind of some of the changes that *T*-1 will happen even more *T*-4 E_S
75198:8	I certainly would n't have been able *-1 to twenty years ago tell you what , uh , my kids were likely *-2 to be like *T*-3 . E_S
75200:10	so I sure would n't have been able *-1 to predict for him . E_S
75229:15	Even , you know , N_S
75242:11	People do seem *-1 to travel more . E_S
75254:8	I know 0 that 's \[ what , \+ uh , what \] my family was talking *T*-1 when I picked up and moved to Texas from Indiana *T*-2 E_S
75255:29	and they were like , well , you know , \[ twen- , \+ thirty \] years ago we would n't have done that , you know . E_S
75255:81	and they were like , well , you know , \[ twen- , \+ thirty \] years ago we would n't have done that , you know . E_S
75263:10	You know , and , N_S
75266:24	Uh , far as , you know , crime in the cities , I 'm sure , 0 like in yours it 's \[ pretty , \+ pretty \] bad . E_S
75266:49	Uh , far as , you know , crime in the cities , I 'm sure , 0 like in yours it 's \[ pretty , \+ pretty \] bad . E_S
75267:10	Uh , probably the biggest thing 0 we 've got *T*-1 going now is the robberies E_S
75268:13	and theft and probably murder are the two top ones that we have *T*-1 . E_S
75275:13	but I 'd probably say 0 that 's roughly right . E_S
75276:23	I mean crimes against property seem *-1 to outnumber crimes against life , E_S
75277:25	but \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 with the current war on drugs and all this kind of stuff I 'd say 0 probably the police department would claim 0 the number one \[ crimes , \+ crimes \] are probably solicitation of prostitution , uh , and sale of drugs . E_S

75280:17	\[ Prob- , \+ probably \] right , if you look at it from that stand point . E_S
75290:10	and I think that they get a lot of fallout from this war on drug thing . Uh , just because there are , like , crack houses , you know , on their street and stuff like this . E_S
75290:91	and I think that they get a lot of fallout from this war on drug thing . Uh , just because there are , like , crack houses , you know , on their street and stuff like this . E_S
75316:33	Our major crimes in our immediate town , uh , is probably \[ robberies , \+ house robberies \]
75317:26	and very few instances of , you know , alcohol , drugs , uh , reported . E_S
75321:16	However , I 'm sure 0 they 're there . E_S
75332:48	And since that time everybody 's got some sort of burglar system or , you know , uh , burglar alarms uh , and including \[ the out , \+ uh , the outer \] perimeter type , uh , devices , sensors and things like that . E_S
75339:24	It 's cut back , you know , considerably , E_S
75345:59	Uh , I would say 0 the majority of it 's happening during the day , uh , between probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon . E_S
75363:38	Uh , so , uh , I would say 0 that 's probably their prime motivation . E_S
75372:78	Uh , you get a few of them that *T*-1 are a little bit sloppier , uh , *-2 just taking , uh , you know , just junk items that \[ they , \+ they \] can just get , you know , ten to twenty bucks for *T*-3 real quick . E_S

75385:17	Very few , you know , \[ penny , \+ penny \] ante stuff . E_S
75387:19	Well , what do you think 0 *T*-1 can be done *-2 * to reduce that sort of crime ? E_S
75390:8	I think 0 they could , uh , definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use *T*-1 . E_S
75392:20	oh , right now I think 0 *T*-1 , we are about thirty thousand people E_S
75406:16	I mean it seems to me 0 that sort of approach will tend *-1 to simply make the cost of * committing the crime slightly higher , E_S
75419:8	I think 0 what they need *-1 to do *T*-2 is * stop *-3 building more jails and start *-3 giving stiffer sentences , uh , E_S
75422:10	So you think 0 that would be a deterrent ? E_S
75424:23	That would \[ be , \+ certainly be \] a deterrent . E_S
75428:26	And , uh , not necessarily , you know , give in to their , uh , human rights desires . E_S
75429:10	You know , if they 're overcrowded , just keep * cramming them in there till they just suffocate .
75434:13	Uh , I think 0 they 'd have *-1 to go to extra measures *-2 to make * sure 0 a person 's guilty , you know , in a lot of cases . E_S
75434:44	Uh , I think 0 they 'd have *-1 to go to extra measures *-2 to make * sure 0 a person 's guilty , you know , in a lot of cases . E_S

75435:28	Course , \[ I , \+ I \] know 0 you ca n't be a hundred percent foolproof . E_S

75454:20	Uh , especially , you know , in the case of murder E_S
75458:13	uh , I know 0 in my case , \[ I , \+ my wife and daughter \] were kidnapped *-1 , during a house robbery back in eighty-five E_S

75480:14	And , you know , he was out within two months because of the parole system . E_S
75492:16	Well , you could probably sue him for mental anguish or something , right , and try *-1 to get money from him E_S
75499:26	and they said , well , you know , \[ \[ he , \+ they 're , \] \+ he \] has no job , E_S
75520:26	\[ And , \+ uh , you know , and \] \[ they 're \+ , right now they 're \] reluctant *-1 to go after him because \[ \[ they 're , \+ you know , they 're , \] \+ they 're \] repeat offenders , E_S

75545:14	and , you know , the guy gets out in two months E_S
75561:8	I think 0 \[ in our , \+ in our \] particular neighborhood , vigilantism is becoming a \[ real , \+ real \] possibility . E_S
75565:60	Uh , we 've had a couple instances where break ins where the people have actually , you know , shot the people *T*-1 E_S
75570:46	they 've actually waited for them , where they 've robbed , you know , particular neighborhood *T*-1 , E_S
75572:30	then other people will wait up , you know , and wait for somebody to do something else , try *-1 to take it in their own hands . E_S
75580:22	But , uh , nevertheless , I think 0 people are just getting fed up and saying , you know , you ca n't arrest all of us , E_S

75602:38	\[ that 's , \+ I mean that 's \] certainly a possibility \[ in , \+ in , \] N_S
75603:49	we have had a few cases where the guy has broken in , you know , during the middle of the night and gotten himself shot *-1 to death *T*-2 . E_S
75616:25	Uh , I would say 0 probably eighty percent of them that *T*-1 are caught *-2 , they 're from places like up in Oklahoma , and Louisiana , Arkansas , you know , across \[ the , \+ the \] border . E_S
75616:100	Uh , I would say 0 probably eighty percent of them that *T*-1 are caught *-2 , they 're from places like up in Oklahoma , and Louisiana , Arkansas , you know , across \[ the , \+ the \] border . E_S
75620:14	So , you know , people who *T*-1 do n't readily read the newspapers in our town or whatever E_S
75629:41	and \[ \[ I , \+ I just , \] \+ I think \] that the court systems need *-1 to be more \[ accurate \[ in , \+ in , \] \+ stiffer in \] their penalties , E_S
75641:8	I think , uh , 0 what I would like *-1 to see *T*-2 is , number one , * completely getting rid *-3 of these victimless crimes .
75646:10	And I think 0 one of the big things that you can do *T*-1 \[ is , \+ *-2 to increase deterrence is , \] uh , if someone is found *-3 guilty of a , uh , felony level offense , they lose their citizenship . E_S
75651:10	You know , and just a lot of things that we 're trying *-1 to worry about , you know , * protecting these people from *T*-2 , we just do n't protect them . E_S

75653:8	I know like 0 in my wife 's case , they made her feel like the criminal . E_S
75655:8	I know , E_S
75656:15	and \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 that 's ridiculous . E_S
75656:26	and \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 that 's ridiculous . E_S
75668:53	and , uh , we bought , uh , this house about , uh , I do n't know , year and a half ago . E_S
75677:20	everything 0 you can think of *T*-1 , that house had *-2 to have *T*-3 . E_S
75683:52	Well , \[ I , \+ I \] really did enjoy it , uh , you know , E_S
75708:19	So , uh , you know , \[ I , \+ we , \] N_S
75712:16	and , as you probably heard \[ from the , \+ in the \] Dallas and Texas area period the housing market is just unreal . E_S
75718:36	This is not \[ what we , \+ you know , what we \] want *-1 to stay in *T*-2 forever , because \[ I have *-3 to have my , \+ I 've found that after *-4 doing this other house , I have *-5 to have my \] hands into stuff E_S
75719:14	and , you know , I 'm always just wanting *-1 to paint \[ and , \+ and \] wallpaper and redo and redo , E_S
75723:19	so , uh , you know , \[ I , \+ I 'm \] ready *-1 to get ahold of another one that I can have a little more input into *T*-2 E_S
75726:10	Well , maybe you can , uh , make that one charming \[ and , \+ and \] make a little bit money , uh , E_S
75729:42	\[ That 's , \+ that 's \] the key , you know , E_S
75730:90	the thing is , uh , 0 when we moved in *T*-1 they had just , uh , painted , \[ wallpa- , \+ we 're , you know , wallpapered , \]
75732:30	so I feel sort of , uh , you know , like it *EXP*-5 's sort of defeating my purpose *-1 to go *-2 rip everything out now and do it over just because I 'm in the mood 0 *-3 to do it *T*-4 . E_S
75745:10	So I know , of what you 're talking about *T*-1 , as far as the market was concerned *-2 E_S
75795:15	And so , I think 0 some of the things that I did *T*-1 paid off . E_S
75796:41	For instance , one thing that I did *T*-1 that *T*-2 might even be a good suggestion for you uh , was something 0 I did *T*-3 on the outside . E_S
75846:22	And , so , well , I thought , gee , I 've been wanting *-1 to , do some brick , uh , walkways for a time . E_S
75926:19	And what satisfaction * to know that you did it in such an inexpensive way . E_S
75938:8	I know 0 my parents bought a house about ten years ago , E_S
75946:14	and , you know , they have *-1 to be doing something constantly . E_S
75948:13	I do n't know if you can put some sort of a plastic sheeting or something \[ \[ un- , \+ on , \] \+ on \] top of the sand and then lay the bricks . E_S
75957:20	And , of course you know you have \[ the , \+ uh , the \] weeds that *T*-1 come up in between the bricks \[ or , \+ and \] things like that . E_S
75986:11	That 's probably , because they had , you know N_S
75986:33	That 's probably , because they had , you know N_S
75988:65	\[ we 're going *-1 to , \+ we 're going *-2 to \] redo the patio , you know , E_S
76000:51	and I also used a rubber hammer , a lot , *-1 to , uh , you know , N_S
76007:97	if it was n't quite level or something , I 'd just get that , rubber hammer \[ \[ and , \+ uh , and , \] \+ and \] prob- , you know , N_S
76011:8	I think that they could , N_S
76012:45	if they have problems with , uh , sand bugs of some kind I think 0 *T*-3 all 0 they need *T*-1 to do *T*-4 is probably *-2 put some insecticide down in there on \[ a , \+ oh , a \] fairly regular basis , for a while anyway . E_S
76012:86	if they have problems with , uh , sand bugs of some kind I think 0 *T*-3 all 0 they need *T*-1 to do *T*-4 is probably *-2 put some insecticide down in there on \[ a , \+ oh , a \] fairly regular basis , for a while anyway . E_S
76024:88	well the thing that *T*-1 's funny is 0 \[ they 've done , \+ uh , they 've done \] things like that , you know , E_S
76029:20	and so , I do n't know what they 're finally going *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S
76030:8	She may just , N_S
76035:18	Well , \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 she needs *-1 to take them to the extension agent and ask him what they are *T*-2 E_S
76035:29	Well , \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 she needs *-1 to take them to the extension agent and ask him what they are *T*-2 E_S
76057:8	I think 0 in this area or most all areas they use , you know , for ticks and fleas . E_S
76057:46	I think 0 in this area or most all areas they use , you know , for ticks and fleas . E_S
76061:12	And you know , they 're , awful hard 0 * to do anything with *T*-1 . E_S
76069:14	and , you know , she 's always telling him , is n't there something \[ that , \+ that \] you can bring *T*-1 home with you that *T*-2 kills everything that you spray *T*-3 , you know , \[ out in the , \+ out in the \] field , that you can get rid *-5 of , these bugs , E_S

76103:44	of everything that I did *T*-1 , I guess 0 I enjoyed probably *-2 wallpapering the most E_S
76104:10	and I thought 0 that would be the hardest thing 0 * to do *T*-1 . E_S

76112:10	You know , I just had a ball with it , E_S
76135:40	So , as far as * looking toward the future , you know , that 's my plan . E_S
76136:44	I 'm going *-1 to have *-2 to move fast , I think , though , because , uh , you know , as a , N_S
76136:70	I 'm going *-1 to have *-2 to move fast , I think , though , because , uh , you know , as a , N_S
76140:18	Do you have any particular thoughts about the school system ? E_S
76142:33	Well , um , \[ I , \+ I \] think that \[ in , \+ in , \] uh , N_S
76144:13	I 'm not sure if it 's more a problem with American families or a problem with the school system . E_S
76145:8	They seem *-1 to be burdening the school system more and more with problems , any problems that a child might have *T*-2 , whether it 's actually a school related thing or not E_S
76145:63	They seem *-1 to be burdening the school system more and more with problems , any problems that a child might have *T*-2 , whether it 's actually a school related thing or not E_S
76158:46	It 's gotten way beyond * \[ teaching , \+ uh , you know , teaching \] classes and maybe providing extracurricular sports activities or something like , oh , were kind of traditionally the school 's roles . E_S
76158:64	It 's gotten way beyond * \[ teaching , \+ uh , you know , teaching \] classes and maybe providing extracurricular sports activities or something like , oh , were kind of traditionally the school 's roles . E_S
76168:138	And I was expressing my frustrations that , uh , \[ some of the , \+ so many \] problems , I work in a high school , are that kids do n't have \[ a , \+ a \] degree of self-discipline which *T*-1 may be reflected *-2 in society at large . E_S
76177:41	\[ And , \+ and , \] you wonder , do n't these parents know that teachers talk , E_S
76178:14	and , you know , we do check with other teachers , E_S
76183:14	And , you know , how do you tell \[ your parent 's , \+ the parent , \] hey , * wake up , and smell the coffee *T*-1 . E_S
76188:15	and I 'm not sure just , uh , \[ how , \+ how \] the school system could operate in a vacuum on it *T*-1 . E_S
76192:8	Whether maybe through a commitment of the P T A , uh , and the parents being informed *-2 better , that in fact that the problems that *T*-1 are nationwide are problems , um , of society , and \[ that , \+ that \] the school can only do so much on it . E_S
76197:62	Well , \[ then , \+ then \] again when you have , uh , a society where a certain percentage of the parents are , uh , doing drugs in the home uh , either unemployed and \[ do n't care about \[ a , \+ uh , just a \] \+ \] have their own problems *T*-1 *T*-2 \[ \[ how , \+ how \] do you expect the school to , \+ um , or how do you expect the , \] N_S
76214:8	You know 0 what *T*-1 scares me too , is that we have yet *-2 to see \[ other , \+ \] the biggest effect of the crack children uh , in the school system . E_S
76227:26	But \[ there are , \+ I think 0 there are \] a couple of areas where the school system can improve *T*-1 , E_S
76256:54	So the school systems can improve , both in * standing up for splitting classes , you know , having \[ \[ learning dis- , \+ learning , \] \+ \[ slow , \+ slow \] \] children in slow classes , but not mixing them with behavior problems . E_S
76260:17	And then , you know , the case where they put the behavior problems in the average classes *T*-1 , E_S
76265:42	And then you throw in kids that *T*-1 are not motivated , maybe bright ,
76275:10	You know , the gifted and talented are fast classes . E_S
76294:10	and I know that there were a lot of kids that *T*-1 were an awful lot smarter than me , E_S
76322:14	and , you know , as a teacher \[ you , \+ you \] try *-1 to \[ make , \+ be \] understanding that , you know , there are different ages , E_S
76322:86	and , you know , as a teacher \[ you , \+ you \] try *-1 to \[ make , \+ be \] understanding that , you know , there are different ages , E_S
76338:161	If we see a child \[ that we have any reason , \+ \] that *T*-1 's on drugs , such as if he 's got a beeper or if they 're , if they 're flashing lots of money around . \[ We 've , \+ \] there are certain things 0 * to do *T*-2 . E_S
76352:20	what could they possibly be thinking *T*-1 . E_S
76361:10	You know , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] amazing , E_S
76364:12	and you know , as a teacher \[ you 're alert , \+ you 're alert \] for the kid who *T*-1 's very drowsy . E_S
76389:14	But , you know , it 's like , uh , this guy was like , why now , there 's no problem with my kid . E_S
76420:14	but , you know , they had *-1 to be held *-2 accountable too . E_S
76424:20	I mean , you know , at some point a parent does help their kid , \[ but \+ \] \[ in , \+ in \] some ways , E_S
76429:10	And I think 0 this is where the school system \[ at , \+ \] is suffering , and not through any fault of the effort of the school system *T*-1 . E_S
76448:34	It *EXP*-3 's amazing how the , you know , people 0 you talk to *T*-1 have some interesting conversations *T*-2 E_S
76449:87	and , uh , it *EXP*-1 's too bad that all this stuff is just being thrown *-2 into a data base , and that none of the ideas or thoughts are being used *-3 at all . E_S

76665:33	uh , \[ the , \+ the \] call was probably for her . E_S
76689:33	Well , the sport 0 I like *T*-1 best probably is basketball . E_S

79316:21	Quite a long time , uh , probably five or six years E_S

79578:16	so I did n't know if they stop you when the time is up *T*-1 E_S

79650:23	\[ wh- , \+ \] I think so too , E_S

79741:8	I think , uh , 0 they 're very helpful ,
79750:13	I made that mistake when I first got a job *T*-1 E_S

79788:46	and he makes calls to people who *T*-1 have problems , you know , credit problems , that *T*-2 are trying *-3 to work out E_S
79796:97	so \[ \[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's , \] \+ uh , it 's , \] \+ uh , it 's \] a really big problem I think , and , um , takes mature people *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] treat it , uh , E_S

79894:12	I was think , N_S
79910:13	I do n't think 0 women look good with muscles . E_S
79931:8	I think 0 \[ I , \+ uh , I \] enjoy it sometimes E_S

80106:30	And \[ he do n't , \+ you know , he do n't \] gain it like I do . E_S
80121:29	and then I got pregnant and , you know , ruined that , E_S
80133:13	I do n't know the difference E_S

80155:25	and really , we was , you know , N_S
80157:12	, you know , * developing and everything . E_S
80172:13	I could n't think , N_S
80210:13	I did n't know 0 it did that . E_S
80212:13	I do n't know if it does to everybody , E_S
80215:22	And he , I do n't know , just , N_S
80221:11	Course I know 0 dogs can get you on a bike too , E_S
80222:12	but , * seems like it , N_S
80232:11	I 've thought about it several times E_S
80237:48	they 've come up that running is not as good for you as they thought 0 it was *?* . E_S
80239:16	\[ It 's probably , \+ I would think 0 it would be \] hard on \[ your , \+ your \] legs and your joints and stuff . E_S
80239:30	\[ It 's probably , \+ I would think 0 it would be \] hard on \[ your , \+ your \] legs and your joints and stuff . E_S
80256:15	just , you know , * be careful *-1 not to slide . E_S
80268:10	At least maybe some of these mountain bikes you could *?* E_S
80275:92	Oh , \[ I , \+ when I \] did ride my friend 's bike , that one time *T*-1 , \[ I had , \+ uh , I do n't know \] what I was trying *-2 to do *T*-3 . E_S
80284:44	she had some kind of fender thing going over the back tire , I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
80320:13	And I 'm thinking about * maybe sponge painting them . Either that or * maybe rag rolling . To give it kind of a country look . E_S
80320:24	And I 'm thinking about * maybe sponge painting them . Either that or * maybe rag rolling . To give it kind of a country look . E_S
80320:48	And I 'm thinking about * maybe sponge painting them . Either that or * maybe rag rolling . To give it kind of a country look . E_S
80380:11	Because you might find that it 's beyond , uh , what you 're willing *-2 to put *T*-1 into it . Although I think 0 it could turn out really nice . E_S
80380:79	Because you might find that it 's beyond , uh , what you 're willing *-2 to put *T*-1 into it . Although I think 0 it could turn out really nice . E_S
80390:10	but I sure did my share of just regular painting . E_S
80419:78	Um , I 'm wondering if my bigger problem is getting the wallpaper taken *-1 down first . Because \[ I , \+ I \] think , N_S
80440:30	If it 's really old , you do n't know what it 's put on with *T*-1 . E_S
80448:10	And I know 0 the house , um , was built *-1 around the mid fifties . E_S
80452:10	So it may be the original wallpaper . E_S
80457:24	If it 's paper it will probably shred . E_S
80459:48	Um , in one bathroom \[ it 's , \+ um , it 's \] probably paper , uh , E_S
80477:114	and he said 0 it *ICH*-2 's a good thing 0 I went to the bathroom before dinner because if I had had something 0 * to drink *T*-1 and went in there I would think 0 I was having hallucinations . E_S
80480:41	Well \[ \[ I , \+ I 've also been *-4 thinking about , \] \+ after * looking at all \[ these magazines , \+ um , these design magazines \] and stuff , I 'm thinking about \] maybe *-1 painting the bedroom walls too , in a color that *T*-2 will kind of , um , tie in \[ \[ our , \+ um , our , \] \+ um , our , \] uh , comforter , with a color that *T*-3 's kind of a , um , burgundy and green and yellow and blue and beige floral design . E_S
80480:112	Well \[ \[ I , \+ I 've also been *-4 thinking about , \] \+ after * looking at all \[ these magazines , \+ um , these design magazines \] and stuff , I 'm thinking about \] maybe *-1 painting the bedroom walls too , in a color that *T*-2 will kind of , um , tie in \[ \[ our , \+ um , our , \] \+ um , our , \] uh , comforter , with a color that *T*-3 's kind of a , um , burgundy and green and yellow and blue and beige floral design .

E_S
80487:25	Um , and I 'm not really quite sure , E_S
80488:13	I do n't know if maybe I 'm biting off more than I can chew *?* . E_S
80488:20	I do n't know if maybe I 'm biting off more than I can chew *?* . E_S
80494:16	well the bedroom would probably be the easier of the two because it would be just plain painting . E_S
80520:63	And then \[ if that , \+ if you \] discover the little tricks and tips about , you know , how you get through corners *T*-1 and how you do trim *T*-2 and , uh , how long * to leave the masking tape down *T*-3 , because if you leave it too long and it dries it can flake \[ when it , \+ when you \] pull it up *T*-4 . E_S
80558:8	I think 0 you \[ are , \+ \] just made my project a lot easier . E_S
80568:24	Well if I were closer I might *?* . E_S
80570:15	and I , really think that it *EXP*-1 's exciting that you 're going *-2 to try the sponge painting . E_S
80571:8	I think 0 that could give it \[ a really \+ a , \] N_S
80574:8	I may just be flat painting over it . E_S
80596:8	I think 0 I get most of my news , uh , in headlines from the radio , E_S
80606:65	and \[ I , \+ I \] feel that \[ the , \+ the \] only legitimate paper , although it might sound , a little elitist is the NEW YORK TIMES . E_S
80629:8	We seem *-1 to start dinner around six and finish it up . E_S
80637:38	I mean , \[ I , \+ I \] do n't believe everything 0 they say *T*-1 , E_S
80638:42	but \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] coverage , you know . E_S
80641:8	I think 0 C N N does a pretty good job . E_S
80649:10	And they seemed *-1 to have the best coverage . E_S
80658:8	I think 0 this is scandalous the way 0 everybody 's picking on him *T*-1 . E_S
80662:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 \[ that what he , \+ he reported what he \] saw *T*-1 E_S
80666:48	and if you did n't like it , that was just too bad , you know . E_S
80668:18	Well , uh , I know that the coverage 0 he was allowed *-1 to present *T*-2 was slanted , E_S
80669:10	but I think 0 they said that frequently enough . That , uh , you should n't criticize the man for * giving us one perspective . E_S
80681:8	I think so . E_S
80685:26	\[ I , \+ I \] have seemed *-1 to slide away from that and rely more on the local paper E_S
80753:33	\[ they ju- , \+ they really \] are probably the worse papers 0 I 've ever read *T*-1 . E_S
80782:62	not as in depth as I used *-2 to *?* , because \[ they , \+ their \] articles seem *-1 to be getting even longer and longer E_S
80791:25	\[ \[ I , \+ I think 0 I , \] \+ I \] agree with you that the problem seems *-1 to be 0 they do n't have enough time 0 * to do all the stuff *T*-2 . E_S

80804:29	If anything , \[ they , \+ I think 0 they \] list- , N_S
80808:18	Well , I do n't know , E_S
80810:25	actually , \[ they , \+ I think 0 they \] slant things E_S
80823:13	I did n't know that . E_S
80842:13	I do n't know E_S
80855:11	I really think . N_S
80858:8	I think 0 I do too . E_S
80859:8	I think 0 \[ \[ you have * to let , \+ yo- , \] \+ you got *-1 to segregate \] some of it . E_S
80878:20	\[ We , \+ I think 0 the last one 0 we \] saw *T*-1 was , uh , TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES PART TWO . E_S
80916:34	it was actually better than the first one , I thought 0 *T*-1 . E_S
80954:21	it 's just , you know , glued to the T V all the time anyway . E_S
80968:10	You know , forty , N_S
80969:16	well I do n't think 0 you all have the same channels , E_S
80986:20	And then , uh , I think GENERAL HOSPITAL E_S
81000:8	I think 0 you would really like PRETTY WOMAN , E_S
81033:52	\[ I mean , \+ I mean \] \[ n- , \+ everybody \] knows \[ that it , \+ that \[ the , \+ the \] language \] is there so they could just ignore it and , you know , use different words instead , I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S

81043:8	I know . E_S
81045:25	But \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 lately PRETTY WOMAN 'S been my favorite . E_S
81047:11	I 've probably seen it about fifteen or twenty times . E_S
81049:43	Um , my husband bought me , like , um , uh , I think * PRETTY IN PINK for my birthday . E_S
81077:13	\[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 SIXTEEN CANDLES was the name of it . E_S
81077:24	\[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 SIXTEEN CANDLES was the name of it . E_S
81099:40	Oh \[ he looks like little , \+ I do n't know , he looks like a little \] boy next door , E_S
81108:18	Huh , I do n't know . E_S
81110:13	* Do n't know either . E_S
81117:11	* Probably know him if I saw him . E_S
81120:28	if I could remember the name , I know 0 you 'd know his name , because he 's played in a few movies . E_S
81120:41	if I could remember the name , I know 0 you 'd know his name , because he 's played in a few movies . E_S
81123:14	I was just thinking 0 another good one 0 I saw *T*-1 not too long ago was , um , * SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY . E_S
81138:8	you know 0 PRETTY WOMAN was kind of a light comedy and a romance , E_S
81167:10	And I think 0 , you know , around here , it 's all ready quit *-1 playing . E_S
81167:23	And I think 0 , you know , around here , it 's all ready quit *-1 playing . E_S
81168:36	But \[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] know if it 's still playing any where else . E_S
81170:26	Well \[ I , \+ I \] think , N_S
81180:38	but it 's just been down here a couple weeks , I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
81186:19	because we saw it , probably , four or five months ago . E_S
81191:11	Well I know 0 it has n't been that long since I 've seen the previews for it , E_S
81222:8	I know , E_S
81223:24	well the only reason 0 I know why it ended *T*-1 *T*-2 is 0 on ARSENIO HALL one night , Christopher Reeves told , that , you know , E_S
81223:86	well the only reason 0 I know why it ended *T*-1 *T*-2 is 0 on ARSENIO HALL one night , Christopher Reeves told , that , you know , E_S
81227:13	I ca n't believe 0 they killed them . E_S
81245:54	Well Arsenio Hall is the one that *T*-1 jumped up and said that I ca n't believe 0 they killed them E_S
81249:10	So I know that they die , E_S
81257:36	well we was , uh , teasing , about , you know , *-1 splitting our house down the middle . E_S
81267:13	I do n't know h- , , N_S
81286:39	and \[ we , \+ our whole house \] has , you know , N_S
81288:20	so we can , you know N_S
81302:8	I know 0 it 's going *-1 to be \[ \[ on , \+ on the , \] \+ on C B S \] Tuesday night E_S
81303:61	\[ an , \+ and \] that 's kind of \[ what , \+ in a way , you know , how \] it kind of bothered you *T*-2 , the way 0 it ended and stuff *T*-1 . E_S
81313:43	and it just left you with this kind of uneasy feeling , you know . E_S
81318:44	uh , THE NEVER ENDING STORY , came out on Disney this month , I think 0 *T*-2 . E_S
81324:15	but I do n't know what it 's about *T*-1 . E_S
81344:8	I think 0 he 's up in a attic , or some part of school . E_S
81352:22	\[ All 0 I know *T*-2 , \+ alls 0 I can really remember *T*-1 \] is him flying this great big dog , this great big huge sheep dog sort of looking thing , E_S
81370:13	I do n't think so . E_S
81386:29	\[ and , \+ and \] you 're not sure whether it will be any good or not E_S
81437:45	so everything around here is set *-1 up that way . Which I think 0 *T*-4 is a little bit different than most areas , in the houses , the way 0 they 're constructed *-3 *T*-2 . E_S
81443:26	Well \[ I , \+ I \] certainly hope so . E_S
81446:40	\[ I shou- , \+ I would \] hate *-1 to think that anybody thought , uh , 0 the lot 0 we live on *T*-2 as a ranch . E_S
81446:50	\[ I shou- , \+ I would \] hate *-1 to think that anybody thought , uh , 0 the lot 0 we live on *T*-2 as a ranch . E_S
81457:28	\[ I , \+ I \] ca n't think of any four bedroom houses in the subdivision . E_S
81458:11	Ours is probably the closest to it . E_S
81459:8	You know how realtors are *T*-1 , E_S
81469:29	The only thing about mine , um , I think 0 there 's probably about , oh ,
81469:42	The only thing about mine , um , I think 0 there 's probably about , oh ,
81472:43	but they 're spaced *-1 out , oh I 'd say *ICH*-2 maybe three , on a two block period . E_S
81474:47	So it *EXP*-1 's kind of hard at that point * to , you know , classify some of the builders . E_S
81497:16	Well I had n't thought about it in that sense , of the high roofs . E_S
81517:5	maybe someday when I feel really ambitious and \[ an- , \+ get angry *T*-2 \] I 'll start *-1 poking holes up there ,
81521:88	\[ \[ ninety , \+ I would say 0 \[ about , \+ oh , about \] ninety-five \] percent , \+ no I guess 0 \[ may- , \+ probably \] a hundred percent \] of them all are mostly brick , uh , with some wood . E_S

81533:38	If it 's the kind of river 0 I 'm thinking of *T*-1 , better \[ them , \+ \[ than , \+ than \] \] us , you know . E_S
81533:96	If it 's the kind of river 0 I 'm thinking of *T*-1 , better \[ them , \+ \[ than , \+ than \] \] us , you know . E_S
81552:13	I do n't think 0 that 's a lot , uh , E_S
81562:8	I know ,
81588:20	I mean , uh , sure , E_S
81591:14	but , you know , they 're going up , E_S
81609:10	and it seemed like the further 0 I got away from Dallas , center *T*-2 , uh , the more lot came with the house \[ and , \+ and \] the lower the price *?* *T*-1 , at the same time . E_S
81610:13	And it just seemed like there was a ten thousand dollar drop for each city . E_S
81612:13	I had n't thought about it that way . E_S
81624:10	But I think 0 Plano 's , N_S
81668:19	And , um , you know , \[ \[ i- , \+ it 's still , \] \+ it 's just \] surrounding the city , E_S
81674:37	\[ and , \+ and \] you can actually , you know , N_S
81680:14	What do you think *T*-2 of \[ that , \+ uh , the \] greenhouse effect that *T*-1 's going on ? E_S
81703:15	I mean , maybe , one snow . E_S
81721:36	Well , Kentucky 's next to Virginia , I 'm pretty sure 0 *T*-1 . E_S
81723:11	I should know E_S
81734:13	they do n't know what snow is *T*-1 . E_S
81768:24	\[ It 's , \+ I think 0 it 's \] just something that *T*-1 goes with the territory . E_S
81786:26	\[ It 's , \+ you know , it 's \] kind of funny , E_S
81788:32	but even , uh , North Carolinians , they do n't know how * to handle cold weather *T*-1 . E_S
81793:13	I do n't know , E_S
81800:13	I do n't know , E_S
81805:12	And you know , you can have snow on the ground and * not be slick on the road . E_S
81816:37	Now of course , \[ there 's , \+ you know , T I is \] here , Oscar Mayer E_S
81823:15	Well , you know , what *T*-1 irks me is these cars that *T*-2 are driving down the road , E_S
81859:13	Well , you know 0 what they 've started *-1 doing *T*-2 \[ is , \+ is \] 0 instead of the tail pipes being at the bottom of those buses they 've started *-3 putting them up at the top , E_S
81868:36	although \[ it , \+ it \] settles , you know , E_S
81870:28	\[ and , \+ and , \] you know , if you 're going *-1 to be jogging on the side of the road , \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] even more miserable . E_S
81873:25	Well , uh , the , you know , pregnant women are n't supposed *-1 to walk along a highway because of that smoke fumes . E_S
81876:13	I did n't know that . E_S
81908:11	it 's probably a lot worse now . E_S
81910:16	Oh , I 'm sure . E_S
81914:52	Well , \[ they , \+ um , you \] can really feel it , you know , in your breathing , even normal people , E_S
81916:20	and it 'll , you know , pass out , E_S
81920:28	and \[ it 's , \+ you know , it 's \] killed several people . E_S
81933:15	and I do n't think 0 I 'd ever , you know , do that , E_S
81933:38	and I do n't think 0 I 'd ever , you know , do that , E_S
81938:26	\[ it was , \+ you know , I was \] just one of those N_S

81969:12	And you know it 'd blow it up north . E_S
81973:9	So , maybe that 's part of the reason 0 it 's not so bad down here *T*-1 . E_S
81978:12	it would seem like it would be the same way \[ in , \+ on \] the California coastline , would n't it *?* ? E_S
81980:18	Oh , gosh , I think 0 I would hate *-1 to live in California ,
81985:23	I mean , I ca n't believe 0 they have warnings here , which \[ it , \+ *T*-2 it 's \] mainly just when it gets real , real hot *T*-1 . E_S
81991:48	\[ W- , \+ well \] that 's kind of good 0 * to know *T*-1 , E_S
81992:15	because \[ I thought \+ lord , I thought \] 0 I lived in a halfway decent area . E_S
81992:29	because \[ I thought \+ lord , I thought \] 0 I lived in a halfway decent area . E_S
81994:8	I think 0 they do that for most everybody . E_S
82012:46	and here they 've got the mountains , the beach , the trees , you know , E_S
82026:8	I know 0 Texas is supposed *-1 to be flat , E_S
82027:31	but \[ they 've got , \+ you know , down by the Denison Dam there 's \] a lot of , uh , N_S
82033:10	do you know 0 my grandparents live in Durant ? E_S
82065:30	and trees are supposed *-1 to , you know , purify . E_S
82066:8	You know what the best indoor purifying plant is *T*-1 for smoke and stuff ? E_S
82115:96	Well , one thing 0 I miss *T*-1 \[ is , \+ uh , is \] 0 the people from Texas , \[ are , \+ are , \] you know , N_S
82176:8	I think 0 one was from Boston . E_S
82229:61	Well , um , \[ w- , \+ we \] do a lot of things with them , you know , E_S
82243:40	my husband , uh , is working \[ mo- , \+ you know , most \] of the time . E_S
82275:86	so \[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's , \] \+ it *EXP*-2 's \] real easy * to work out my schedule , you know , *-3 \[ \[ to , uh , get in , \+ to , \] \+ to still stay in \] with that , \[ an , \+ and \] to have enough time 0 * to spend *T*-1 with Matthew . E_S

82328:8	I think 0 \[ it 's , \+ uh , it \] gives me a break . E_S
82337:36	and yet she 'd get *-1 to spend , you know , three or four days with ... N_S
82347:17	and , um , I think 0 that was really ideal , uh . E_S
82352:56	but then when you start *-1 having two of them *T*-2 , it 's , you know , a little bit tougher , because you 've got *-3 to make a little more money , *-4 to make that payoff and stuff . E_S
82398:23	Well , um , I do n't know , E_S
82404:73	but , uh , as far as during the week , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] usually , uh , you know , just my son and I , E_S
82421:11	I 'm sure 0 it does . E_S
82423:24	But , um , it , you know , N_S
82439:104	and so \[ that , \+ that \] got me \[ to sp- , \+ to be able *-1 to spend \] more time with the kids at night and stuff , you know , 'cause normally \[ if , \+ if \] they need something they just go to mom . No matter what it is *T*-2 , E_S
82455:14	but , you know , we 'd go to the library and do things like that , E_S
82461:8	I know 0 my husband was real , uh , N_S
82485:15	He , you know , N_S
82490:8	I think 0 \[ \[ it , \+ it really , \] \+ it *EXP*-1 really \] helped * to have that time together . E_S
82494:11	because I think 0 \[ yu- , \+ you know , you \] grow closer . E_S
82494:35	because I think 0 \[ yu- , \+ you know , you \] grow closer . E_S
82509:33	So \[ it 's , \+ uh , you know , there 's \] a lot of kids in the family E_S
82520:54	\[ And , \+ and \] the cost of living here is just so tremendously , you know , outrageous . E_S
82532:34	\[ I 'm , \+ I , \] you know N_S
82533:43	\[ it 's , \+ it 's \] hard because , you know , N_S

82542:52	you got *-1 to do what you got *-3 to do *T*-2 , you know *-1 to get along , too , E_S
82559:8	I know . E_S
82562:52	\[ but . \+ But , \] for the most part , \[ I , \+ you know , I 've \] really feel like that 's led , N_S

82566:21	the way that , you know , we- , jus- , N_S
82567:48	like what you said *T*-1 with the cost of living and everything , I think 0 a lot of people ca n't afford *-2 to get by on just one salary \[ an \+ and \] wo n't *?* . E_S
82574:13	And so I think 0 that 's \[ le- , \+ tended *-1 to lead \] to a decline \[ in , \+ in \] families and family values especially . E_S
82579:13	And I really think that that 's one of the problems 0 the nation 's facing *T*-1 that , you know , we need *-3 to do something about *T*-2 , E_S

82580:15	but I do n't know what . E_S
82582:8	I believe that too , E_S
82583:10	and I think , uh , 0 the kids are where they need *-1 to , you know *T*-2 , N_S
82583:57	and I think , uh , 0 the kids are where they need *-1 to , you know *T*-2 , N_S
82590:58	\[ Would , \+ would \] you have said that a couple of years ago , do you think ? E_S

82593:77	\[ I did n't , \+ I did n't \] even really think about it that much , I mean 0 *T*-1 , you know , E_S

82621:10	You know , \[ th- , \+ that 's \] how they 're developing their patterns *T*-1 . E_S

82671:55	Well , \[ \[ I , \+ I 've \] been , \+ uh , I have probably had \] more time than you have *?* 0 * to think about this subject *T*-1 , E_S

82678:11	I do believe 0 it 's a serious problem . E_S
82690:16	Uh , we 're probably making a comparison against , uh , some European \[ and , \+ uh , and , \] uh , uh , s-s-say , newer republics \[ that , \+ uh , that \] *T*-1 have very high percentages . E_S
82698:8	God knows why we hold it on Tuesdays *T*-1 . E_S
82699:39	And then we further complicate it by *-1 saying , you know , 0 we will keep the polls open until eight o'clock . E_S
82708:49	My solution to that is that we hold it on Sundays . As do probably sixty to seventy percent of the European countries now . E_S
82734:23	\[ I \+ , I \] know here in Dallas that they have just instituted in the last couple of years , \[ a , \+ uh , a \] real long period of time that you can absentee vote *T*-1 before the elections . E_S

82866:8	Everybody seems disappointed , E_S

82961:8	I think 0 voters are motivated , uh ... E_S
82968:18	Well , I do n't know if they have higher turnouts overall . E_S

82972:13	I do n't think 0 England has *?* , E_S
82973:8	I think 0 England has about a seventy percent , sixty-five percent turn out . E_S

82999:41	\[ But \+ \[ th- , \+ \] but , \] you know , everything is relative to when , uh , eh , \[ w-w- , \+ you know , we \] had higher turnouts *T*-1 because at that time we \[ cur- , \+ \] talk about the turnout relative to the eligible voter , right ? E_S

83069:10	You know , Karen , I wonder if we are recording . E_S
83077:18	Well , uh , it seems to me \[ that , \+ uh , that \] N_S
83078:13	I do not know whether the jury system , uh , N_S
83079:43	\[ I , \+ I \] should not say 0 I do not know . E_S
83081:8	It seems *-1 to have worked , uh , time immemorial . E_S
83086:13	Uh , I know 0 in some cases now in some states , depending on the criminal code , uh , a unanimous verdict is not required *-1 . E_S
83088:71	they are down to \[ as little , \+ as small \] as six people \[ \[ \[ in , \+ I think , in \] petty , \] \+ \[ \[ \[ in , \+ in , \] \+ uh , in , \] uh , in \] minor \] felonies , \[ and , \+ uh , and \] misdemeanor trials . E_S
83092:14	Uh , I think that the judges should be left *-1 to do most of the sentencing , simply because , uh , \[ there is always , \+ uh , \[ there is , \+ there is \] always \] a jury that *T*-2 might be swayed *-3 , uh , by the moment , uh , * \[ to \+ either to \] be too lenient or too vengeful , I guess 0 *T*-5 .

83097:83	On the other hand , uh , \[ attorney , \+ uh , uh , justices \] are more apt *-1 to , uh , understand , you know , \[ the cr- , \+ the prison \] crowding problems and things like that , and have that sway their decisions one way or the other . You know . E_S
83097:164	On the other hand , uh , \[ attorney , \+ uh , uh , justices \] are more apt *-1 to , uh , understand , you know , \[ the cr- , \+ the prison \] crowding problems and things like that , and have that sway their decisions one way or the other . You know . E_S
83106:31	and the people in various states , it does not seem that people want *-1 to be taxed *-2 *-2 to build more prisons . Or even \[ in , \+ \] for that matter , uh , repair \[ the , \+ uh , the \] lack of judges \[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ and \] other , uh , N_S

83119:10	you know , that might be it . E_S
83119:18	you know , that might be it . E_S
83120:33	I mean , \[ they , \+ they \] certainly , N_S

83126:34	\[ I do not , \+ I do n't \] know how it is *T*-1 in Virginia , E_S

83145:43	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] do not know , E_S
83146:11	it just seems to me that \[ \[ only about , \+ uh , from what I read *T*-1 , only about ninety percent of the ca- , \] \+ only about ten percent of the \[ pa- , \+ cases \] \] come for trial anyway . E_S
83165:28	\[ Do you , \+ do you \] think 0 that should be changed *-1 ? E_S

83170:8	I know 0 one of my friends was , uh , uh , brought *-1 up for jury duty . E_S
83175:27	and he only heard very , you know , piddly type cases . E_S
83176:48	Most of it was , uh , robberies or things like that , you know , E_S
83178:53	So apparently even for the smallest crimes , they give the person \[ the , \+ you know , any \] felony anyways . E_S
83187:10	But I know 0 you have a right * to ask for a jury \[ in , \+ in \] any sort of a case that even where damages \[ \[ \[ are , \+ are , \] \+ are , \] \+ uh , are \] the result of some sort of \[ a , \+ uh , an \] action that you are bringing *T*-1 against someone else *T*-2 .

83198:43	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] do not know , uh , E_S

83231:8	I know , E_S
83232:18	it , uh , does seem like \[ \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the , \] \+ the \] purpose of * getting people in jail so that , you know , \[ the , \+ the , \] N_S
83232:107	it , uh , does seem like \[ \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the , \] \+ the \] purpose of * getting people in jail so that , you know , \[ the , \+ the , \] N_S
83233:13	I can not think of the word 0 I am looking for *T*-1 . E_S
83239:13	I do not know , E_S

83247:67	I mean the prison population , uh , as far as \[ I , \+ I , \] uh , you know , N_S
83254:48	But \[ there , \+ there \] definitely is , uh , uh , you know , to me \[ the , \+ one of the \] worst things that *T*-1 could ever happen , uh , from what I read and see and understand *T*-2 . E_S
83255:22	I mean I do no think 0 I could handle prison . E_S
83272:50	\[ But , \+ but \] there again \[ I , \+ I \] do not know if \[ the , \+ the \] jury system itself , uh , comes in * to play there . E_S
83273:11	I would think that , N_S
83276:31	I mean \[ that , \+ it \] seems to me \[ \[ that , \+ that , \] \+ that \] when a jury makes a decision *T*-1 , they should not be asked *-2 , uh , before television cameras and newspaper reporters how they reached that decision *T*-3 . E_S
83281:28	I imagine 0 there is a \[ certain , \+ certain \] right *ICH*-1 of the press * to have the ability * to ask that . E_S
83281:35	I imagine 0 there is a \[ certain , \+ certain \] right *ICH*-1 of the press * to have the ability * to ask that . E_S
83282:28	But \[ I , \+ I \] would think 0 \[ I , \+ if I \] did anything , I would protect the juror \[ from , \+ from \] any sort of an inquisition after . E_S
83284:13	Well , I know , uh , E_S
83285:56	on the other hand though , when , uh- , after the Barry trial , up here , you know , the big local trial , as well as national . N_S
83302:118	Uh , after the case was over , I was like , somebody get ahold of these people and find out why in the world did they vote the way 0 they did *T*-1 *T*-2 , you know . E_S
83312:13	I do not know what they wanted *T*-1 honestly . E_S
83314:13	I do not know . N_S

83316:13	\[ I think , \+ I , \] N_S

83344:15	But I do not know , E_S
83345:5	maybe when you are there \[ in the r- , \+ in the courtroom \] yourself and you are sitting there and you have got *-1 to make a judgment on somebody *T*-2 . N_S

83400:53	\[ Did he , \+ did he \] hook up the \[ wir- , \+ wiring \] wrong ? E_S

83426:8	they probably built that in so they could make money . E_S
83433:70	there 's a little sensing device , uh , \[ in front of my , \+ uh , um , I 'm not sure , right in front of \] the \[ f- , \+ fan , \] E_S

83509:26	I 've only taken , uh , maybe two trips that *T*-1 were about four hours long \[ dow- , \+ uh , down \] to Shreveport . E_S
83510:43	And , uh , the rest of it \[ was , \+ you know , it 's \] just basically * driving a long ways to work . E_S
83517:39	But I guess 0 because they 're highway miles , you know , it 's not so bad on your car \[ as , \+ as \] if it , you know , were just regular street , you know . E_S
83517:98	But I guess 0 because they 're highway miles , you know , it 's not so bad on your car \[ as , \+ as \] if it , you know , were just regular street , you know . E_S
83517:121	But I guess 0 because they 're highway miles , you know , it 's not so bad on your car \[ as , \+ as \] if it , you know , were just regular street , you know . E_S
83529:34	I was going *-1 to ask you , you know , as far as how we 're getting compensated *-2 for what we 're doing *T*-4 right now *T*-3 , um , N_S
83532:13	I do n't know what you want *-1 to call them *T*-2 ,
83553:8	I know someone that *T*-1 did that , E_S
83559:28	well that 's good 0 * to know *T*-1 . E_S
83567:27	And , uh , I 've done it maybe twelve times . E_S
83571:16	Well I do n't know if I 've done it quite that much , E_S
83583:30	\[ I , \+ I \] figured 0 maybe I 'd get one or two years out of it , E_S
83588:14	and , you know , he just said 0 he could n't fix it E_S
83598:8	I think 0 those old cars \[ might , \+ might \] be a pretty good bet because you , N_S
83598:26	I think 0 those old cars \[ might , \+ might \] be a pretty good bet because you , N_S
83598:34	I think 0 those old cars \[ might , \+ might \] be a pretty good bet because you , N_S
83604:13	I do n't know ,
83608:15	and MUMBLEx you know , it ran fine . E_S
83614:46	\[ And , \+ um , but \] I had *-1 to , you know , ge- , N_S
83615:10	you know , \[ I , \+ MUMBLEx \[ after \+ about \[ thr- , \+ couple \] of months after \] I \] was out of college I finally splurged and bought my car E_S

83631:31	and some people will still buy them , you know , E_S
83641:16	I just do n't know how much they 'll want *-1 to charge me *T*-2 *-3 to , N_S
83647:13	but I just think 0 they cost too much \[ in the , \+ in the \] first place , now a days . E_S
83668:8	I know , E_S
83677:8	You know what ? E_S
83678:8	It seems like we are doing it here forever . E_S
83680:55	I mean , \[ it , \+ it \] \[ was \+ \[ pro- , \+ probably \] was \] up to your shoulder \[ in , \+ in \] thistles . E_S
83688:19	And I have since then probably ripped out half of what he has done *T*-1 because it has always been incorrectly planted *-2 E_S
83692:130	And so I am kind of at this point getting a little bit broke and deciding that what we are going *-1 to do *T*-2 is 0 we are just going *-3 to struggle through the rest of this year , probably through the Fall too . And , uh , \[ rip up , \+ rip out \] all the rest of these junipers or anything that *T*-4 requires , uh , more care than I am willing * to give the kids *T*-5 and replace it with hollies . E_S
83706:10	so it seems like a lot more . E_S
83722:15	and I do not know if that counts . E_S
83782:10	You know , once , N_S
83785:13	now are you sure 0 they are hyacinths ? E_S
83809:11	I have probably planted , oh , around here , um , maybe six hundred bulbs . E_S
83809:38	I have probably planted , oh , around here , um , maybe six hundred bulbs . E_S
83814:15	I \[ have probably \+ have \] done hyacinths . E_S
83837:34	\[ I do not , \+ I am not \] sure what they are called *-1 *T*-2 . E_S

83858:18	well , I do not know what I have called them *T*-1 . E_S
83861:8	You know what I bet you *T*-1
83870:33	And our neighborhood is a planned development with , I think , 0 it is *RNR*-1 seven hundred and fifty-five families . E_S
83910:10	You know , \[ I , \+ I \] really do not know . E_S
83910:41	You know , \[ I , \+ I \] really do not know . E_S

83970:34	\[ I do not , \+ I am not \] sure what it is *T*-1 . E_S

83983:13	I do not know what it is *T*-1 . E_S
83995:60	Because \[ \[ I have got a flower , \+ I have got , \] \+ I have probably got , \] \[ \[ \[ \[ do , \+ do , \] \+ do , \] \+ do , \] \+ I do \] not know how many square feet it is *T*-1 , a big circular driveway . E_S

84019:26	Ooh , blue is hard , you know . E_S
84040:15	But I did not know that these hyacinths , N_S

84042:13	I did not know 0 the \[ hya- , \+ hyacinths \] were going *-1 to die . E_S
84045:20	Well , the , you know , \[ e- , \+ nursery \] men \[ will se- , \+ will sell \] you things here . E_S
84122:18	Well , I do not know . E_S
84138:61	And \[ I am , \+ I am \] afraid *-1 to go down there because , you know , I mean , you hear about people getting mugged *-2 . E_S
84149:18	That is , uh , probably enough * to see . E_S
84164:20	Are bases safe , you know ? E_S
84195:65	but \[ it is , \+ uh , it is \] bad everywhere in terms of , uh , you know , the handgun situation , um , the number of rapes , the number of muggings . E_S
84201:10	You know , people put bars on their windows in certain neighborhoods E_S
84201:35	You know , people put bars on their windows in certain neighborhoods E_S
84206:10	you know . They call them ornamental grates . E_S
84214:22	but , uh . I do not know , E_S
84217:15	so I do not know \[ what , \+ you know , what \] *T*-1 can be done *-2 . E_S

84218:18	I am , you know , N_S
84220:34	\[ I do not , \+ I do not \] know , E_S
84223:8	it seems *-1 to , N_S
84224:8	I think 0 it is getting worse . Because I keep *-1 hearing things N_S
84248:52	Like that girl in New York that *T*-1 got beat *-2 up by , you know , N_S when she was jogging in Central Park *T*-3 , a couple of years ago ? E_S
84256:26	\[ They were not , \+ I think 0 they were \] early twenties . E_S

84306:8	I know . E_S
84308:13	I do not know . E_S
84310:10	You know , you must , N_S
84311:8	I think 0 T V is bad . Because they , uh , show all sorts of violence on , N_S
84314:15	and I do not think 0 a lot of parents , N_S
84315:44	I mean , \[ I do not , \+ I do not \] know how it is *T*-1 in the Air Force base . E_S
84316:25	But , uh , I just do not think 0 a lot of people , because of the economy , both need *-1 to work , you know . E_S
84316:83	But , uh , I just do not think 0 a lot of people , because of the economy , both need *-1 to work , you know . E_S
84317:16	I just do not think 0 a lot of parents are that involved any more . E_S
84328:13	I do not know how your folks were *T*-1 , E_S
84329:18	but I mean I sure knew as heck when I was growing up *T*-1 that , uh , my parents were the superior E_S
84331:14	And , you know . It was sort of like there were boundaries . E_S
84335:20	And \[ I do not think , \+ I do not know , \]
84335:36	And \[ I do not think , \+ I do not know , \]
84336:8	I think 0 today a lot of parents , um , are ruled *-1 by their kids . E_S
84339:8	I think so definitely . E_S
84346:13	I do not know how old you are *T*-1 , E_S
84349:97	and \[ I , \+ uh , I \] see , uh , even people that *T*-1 work with me that *T*-2 are ten years younger . E_S That , you know , *T*-1 they kind of have an attitude that ,
84381:54	And so all the young engineers are like , well , I am just , going , you know , E_S
84386:17	And that , you know , N_S
84425:10	you know , at least the Air Force is , N_S
84426:13	I do not know ,
84428:32	I mean , \[ I , \+ you know , I mean , I \] go to like an aerobics class or something . E_S
84429:26	And , \[ I , \+ you know , uh , seventy women \] in a Jazzercise class in a public , uh , parks and rec building . E_S
84433:14	but , you know , it is an inter racial mix . E_S
84438:18	And I do not even think that way , E_S
84439:26	but I mean , you just think to yourself , \[ you , \+ you \] just , I mean , N_S
84440:11	nobody can think \[ that , \+ that \] it ca n't happen to them . E_S
84444:52	No matter who they are *T*-1 E_S or where they are at *T*-2 , you know . N_S
84447:13	And you never know who *T*-1 is watching , either . E_S
84450:13	I do not know ,
84488:13	I do not know if you have seen . E_S
84495:8	I think 0 she is a freshman . E_S
84510:27	But I just looked at the picture and thought , what a world . E_S
84512:8	I know . E_S
84527:58	People , I mean , even dry cleaners knock on the door and are soliciting , \[ you know . \+ \] E_S
84534:10	And I think sometimes 0 it is just , 0 he and I are very different in terms of that . E_S
84545:10	and I probably got more nasty than I should have *?* . E_S
84550:10	you know , E_S
84559:17	Or people , you know ,
84581:10	And I know 0 I never felt , N_S

84596:79	* Do not deny yourself the New York \[ \[ exper- , \+ bu- , \] \+ experience , \] but go with people that you know *T*-1 . E_S

84604:15	Uh , E_S I think 0 the handgun , N_S
84611:8	I think 0 our justice system needs *-1 to be stricter . I mean , because \[ everyone , \+ they \] do it E_S
84615:38	and then they get out in a couple of years it seems like *T*-1 .
84619:13	I do not know how the New York state prison system is *T*-1 E_S
84634:34	\[ I do not , \+ I do not \] know . Because I am not real up on a lot of news things . E_S

84647:8	I know . E_S
84648:13	And then you think ,
84652:10	And you think to yourself , was it that bad back then ? E_S
84654:8	I think that , like you said , television ? E_S
84655:22	Is it just that more people think 0 there is like excitement in it , you know ? E_S
84655:55	Is it just that more people think 0 there is like excitement in it , you know ? E_S
84656:27	I mean , people that *T*-1 may have been close to the edge just go over because they see something or read something . E_S
84658:8	It seems like a lot of , i- , N_S that it is more ,
84668:58	And they were like , well , no one was going *-1 to miss him anyway , you know , E_S
84674:17	How can you even think like that *T*-1 ? E_S
84683:10	You know , it is just ,
84684:8	I think 0 kids get too much too fast . And all those sort of things . E_S
84691:56	In Atlanta , where my inlaws live *T*-1 , uh , they had that thing , you know , the high top sneakers , the Air Jordans , et cetera . E_S
84710:10	You know , * stealing the hundred dollar jackets . E_S
84713:11	That is probably one of the most bizarre 0 I have heard of *T*-1 . E_S
84720:8	It seems like crime is turning into a pastime instead of like , you know , be ... N_S
84720:48	It seems like crime is turning into a pastime instead of like , you know , be ... N_S
84734:95	and so , uh , it *EXP*-1 's important for you * to spend time * doing the things that you want them to learn *T*-2 , you know , \[ that , \+ that \] they need *-3 to learn *T*-4 at the age , you know * \[ reading , and , \+ uh , reading and \] playing nice with others , and that sort of thing .

E_S
84743:106	and we 've always , uh , oh tried *-1 to take our children and \[ no- , \+ now \] at this age our grandchildren to see and do things that otherwise they might not be able *-3 to *?* *T*-2 . E_S
84744:8	I think 0 that 's just part of their overall educational process , is * to get out and see and do things . E_S

84799:8	I think 0 it was in the sixth grade , E_S
84865:39	Well , uh , that 's about all 0 I can think *-1 to talk about *T*-2 right now . E_S
84866:20	It *EXP*-1 's been a pleasure * talking with you . E_S
84878:19	Um , what do you think 0 the major cause of air pollution or at least in the Boston areas , N_S
84880:53	Well , \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the \] major cause it seems 0 *T*-1 up here is exc- , N_S
84886:32	but the major cause here , and we always seem *-3 to , and it seems *-1 to be validated *-2 by the press , is the car pollution . E_S
84886:49	but the major cause here , and we always seem *-3 to , and it seems *-1 to be validated *-2 by the press , is the car pollution . E_S
84892:15	Uh , car pollution seems *-1 to be the one and only thing \[ that , \+ that \] I can really put my finger on *T*-2 here . E_S
84905:13	I did n't know that . E_S
84907:31	and that 's always something that , you know , \[ you just do n't real , \+ you do n't think \] about *T*-1 . E_S
84907:69	and that 's always something that , you know , \[ you just do n't real , \+ you do n't think \] about *T*-1 . E_S
84917:11	I would think so . E_S
84918:10	You know , uh , \[ i- , \+ I guess 0 it \] talked about all types of pollution . E_S
84926:13	I do n't think 0 it 's involved *ICH*-1 any longer \[ with , \+ with , \] uh , hair sprays or those th- , N_S
84932:10	I think \[ 0 it 's \+ now , \[ is what , \+ uh , from what \] I understand *T*-1 it 's \] air conditioning units E_S
84933:26	\[ and , \+ and , \] we certainly turned into an air conditioned society . E_S
84943:8	I know 0 in Florida there 's no place 0 you go *T*-2 that *T*-1 is n't air conditioned , E_S
84947:16	I mean you know what it 's like *T*-1 here . N_S
84974:10	you know , improved . N_S
84982:42	but demanding that , uh , we can spend so much money on certain things but that research really be directed *-1 toward , um , improvement of polluting vehicles , and not just cars but also buses , um , planes . That something can be done *-2 .
84993:8	I think that it can be done *-1 simply because , uh , uh , \[ we 've , \+ we 've , \] N_S
85007:10	And I think that \[ there are \+ \[ th- , \+ there \] are \] solutions , E_S
85011:5	certainly we do n't even \[ need a , \+ need a \] research anymore . E_S
85022:13	I do n't know if you ever got caught *-1 in a traffic jam behind a bus , E_S
85027:15	That , you know , N_S
85030:26	\[ and \+ but , \] you know , I was reading the other day * not to go on with this but that , diesel fumes actually have less pollutants in them than gasoline fumes . E_S
85046:40	I mean , \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] thinking of research in that direction rather than N_S
85048:15	but I do n't think , 0 fossil fuels are the answer . E_S
85050:20	Well , we , you know N_S
85054:70	right close to where I live *T*-1 is *T*-2 the Seabrook Nucleus site which *T*-3 is , practically a , you know , guerilla war up here ,
85078:29	\[ Un- , \+ unfortunately \] though I think 0 the oil companies have lied to us for years . E_S
85083:18	So we really do n't know whether there 's enough fossil fuel left * E_S or there is n't *?* , E_S
85129:10	And California seems *-1 to be taking steps , E_S
85154:34	And \[ it , \+ it \] really is a pleasure for me , although , I guess 0 smokers do n't think that . E_S
85154:69	And \[ it , \+ it \] really is a pleasure for me , although , I guess 0 smokers do n't think that . E_S
85161:54	that was its most \[ personal , \+ personal , \] uh , pollution that I can think of *T*-1 . E_S
85196:8	I think 0 right now \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] kind of bad .
85219:22	Uh , this one , you know , gave us free cable and , uh , ceiling fans E_S
85233:38	Uh , but \[ \[ there 's , \+ you know , there , \] \+ there are \] a lot of buildings E_S
85292:17	All the developers do n't know what * to do *T*-1 . E_S
85327:40	and then they rented the third floor with the whole apartment , you know . E_S
85334:24	and \[ they , \+ you know , they \] finished the basement , E_S
85341:38	And I 've looked at a lot of them , you know . E_S
85344:20	a friend of mine was thinking about *-1 coming down there , E_S
85345:41	and that 's what he said *T*-1 was that , you know , it just was n't something that people had *T*-2 down there . E_S
85363:11	I always think 0 it 's like a desert , E_S
85364:13	I do n't know . E_S
85371:10	you know , I do n't see that kind of sand here .
85376:31	or the foundation is sinking or something . You know , \[ just a little , \+ just a little \] bit , some more than others . E_S
85377:35	But \[ you , \+ you \] have *-1 to know the right spot , 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] pick *T*-3 where that does n't happen *T*-2 . E_S
85385:106	Well , out here \[ we , \+ um , we \] live in what *T*-1 used *-2 to be , uh , like a prairie or whatever a \[ natural , \+ you know , natural \] grasslands . E_S
85433:47	And , uh , \[ in the , \+ in the \] Dallas , you know , Fort Worth city areas you do n't see that . E_S

85457:54	But , um , it 's considered *-1 the country since it 's , uh , you know , that far out . E_S
85469:14	and , you know , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] still pretty rural . E_S
85502:70	but , um , for the most part \[ i- , \+ \[ they , \+ they \] \] always had , you know , N_S
85504:17	and so , you know , as soon as we could \[ we , \+ we \] got a single family home , E_S
85544:12	but , I think 0 it 's , N_S
85546:15	so I do n't know too much about it . E_S
85553:15	Um , you know , \[ I , \+ I \] just wanted *-1 to see if , you know , you had an opinion about this , E_S
85553:64	Um , you know , \[ I , \+ I \] just wanted *-1 to see if , you know , you had an opinion about this , E_S
85554:14	or , you know . N_S
85568:20	Um , E_S \[ I think \+ I mean , \[ if , \+ if \] I start \] this I just wanted *-1 to say that , um , one of the things that I do n't think 0 we really understood *T*-2 about \[ the , \+ the \] middle eastern situation is that they 're a totally different type of people than we are *?* , E_S

85569:18	and I mean they think differently E_S
85571:46	\[ And , \+ and \] right now , \[ I , \+ I \] think that that 's been proven *-1 in the fact that , um , they have just , N_S
85572:21	well , anyway , I just think that , you know , the United States policy over there , N_S
85572:34	well , anyway , I just think that , you know , the United States policy over there , N_S
85573:8	I think 0 we should just leave them alone . E_S
85574:90	I really do . \[ In , \+ in \] a major way because \[ they just , \+ um , that whole region over there , \] I think 0 *T*-2 needs *-1 to settle its own differences within itself . E_S
85579:20	I mean , you know , we can maybe help them a little bit , prompt them , E_S
85579:31	I mean , you know , we can maybe help them a little bit , prompt them , E_S
85580:15	but I do n't think 0 this intervention at such high levels should be going on . E_S
85581:41	\[ The , \+ the \] thing with Israel and Palestine , I believe 0 that should be settled *-1 between them . E_S
85582:22	And also , um , you know , the other thing is 0 \[ their idea , \+ or our \[ ide- , \+ idea \] \] of democracy has nothing 0 * to do *T*-1 with them . E_S
85584:21	\[ and , \+ and \] maybe this is too general , E_S
85585:13	but I just believe that , um , they do not look at democracy the same way 0 we do *T*-1 . E_S
85590:19	And , so , you know , * trying *-1 to put like a square peg in a round hole is just , you know , N_S
85590:74	And , so , you know , * trying *-1 to put like a square peg in a round hole is just , you know , N_S
85591:28	\[ i- , \+ I \] do n't think that that 's the way 0 * to go *T*-1 in this E_S
85592:19	and , um , you know , \[ \[ \[ it , \+ it . \] \+ Oh , well , that 's , \] \+ that 's \] a couple thoughts on it . E_S

85596:36	\[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 , you know , I 'd like you to maybe express something here . E_S
85596:58	\[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 , you know , I 'd like you to maybe express something here . E_S
85598:41	Well \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] think 0 overall that 's right . E_S
85599:8	I think 0 it 's kind of sad *ICH*-2 though , that , for generations they 've been taught *-1 to hate each other . E_S
85603:36	And \[ that 's , \+ i- , \] you know , N_S
85610:10	You know , \[ an , \+ an , \] \[ I , \+ I \] think that , um , N_S
85610:53	You know , \[ an , \+ an , \] \[ I , \+ I \] think that , um , N_S
85612:29	but , uh , at the same time , I think 0 \[ there are a lot of , \+ there is a lot of \] good that the United States and other countries can do *T*-1 , as far as example E_S
85613:33	\[ and , \+ and , \] uh , , I think 0 some different things *ICH*-2 could come from what *T*-1 's happened *T*-1 , than what we expect *T*-3 . E_S
85619:13	the war has certainly sort of set things on end over there E_S

85632:21	I 'm sorry . You know , E_S
85633:50	but , um , \[ \[ i- , \+ I , \] \+ I \] just think 0 , you know , you 're right E_S
85633:63	but , um , \[ \[ i- , \+ I , \] \+ I \] just think 0 , you know , you 're right E_S

85635:58	It 's not going *-1 to be that we 're going *-2 to , uh , you know , sort of , tell them to go to their room E_S
85648:14	And , you know , N_S
85667:29	They love violent leaders , to , you know , E_S
85668:29	I mean * look at , you know , the leader 0 they had *T*-1 . E_S
85673:14	and , you know , for a while there he had them , be- , N_S
85683:10	and I know this only because from personal experience that I 'm speaking of this , E_S
85684:36	because \[ I , \+ I 've , \] you know , traveled around town with different cab drivers in a situation where I 've done that *T*-1 E_S
85691:19	, I mean , every thought , E_S
85696:10	You know , and when you add the , um , commercialization of the western world *T*-1 it sort of screws everything up for them . E_S
85702:16	and they just really believe in Allah , or God , or whatever . E_S
85706:28	And \[ it 's , \+ you know , everything is \] to the glory of Allah , E_S
85707:35	\[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ you know , and , \] \[ it , \+ it 's \] almost like , N_S

85724:12	Which I think that *T*-2 that 's not \[ the , \+ the \] way 0 the majority of the people over there really are *T*-1 . E_S
85729:15	But \[ I think 0 \[ in a , \+ in a \] way the war , \+ uh , I think 0 in a way all , the involvement \] over there too , though , has shown \[ a lot of people \+ that there are a lot of people \] that *T*-1 do n't follow what those few are doing *T*-2 . E_S

85735:10	You know , there 's , N_S
85736:25	and \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 we may not have ever have seen that without some of these , uh , newspeople being in there in the broadcasts and \[ the , \+ the , \] uh , soldiers leaving , um , you know , surrendering and , trying *-1 to get out of that situation . E_S
85736:35	and \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 we may not have ever have seen that without some of these , uh , newspeople being in there in the broadcasts and \[ the , \+ the , \] uh , soldiers leaving , um , you know , surrendering and , trying *-1 to get out of that situation . E_S

85745:33	\[ And , \+ and , \] the , you know , N_S
85747:40	it just really comes down to people are people , you know , E_S
85753:15	Um , you know , E_S there are political boundaries E_S
85755:14	but , you know , for heaven sakes , that 's something that *T*-1 's been *-2 going on for ages , E_S
85757:25	and \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 so much of it is what you 're taught *T*-1 . E_S
85762:10	You know , they teach their children , uh , in such a way that , N_S
85764:24	Uh , national health insurance , I think , is a problem inasmuch as the quality of health care that people would receive *T*-1 . E_S
85776:8	I think that \[ the , \+ the \] answer may lie \[ in , \+ uh , not in \] so much a , uh , national kind of medical thing that li- , like 0 England has *T*-1 but more of a , um , national insurance , uh , sort of clearinghouse or whatever . E_S
85776:35	I think that \[ the , \+ the \] answer may lie \[ in , \+ uh , not in \] so much a , uh , national kind of medical thing that li- , like 0 England has *T*-1 but more of a , um , national insurance , uh , sort of clearinghouse or whatever . E_S
85777:8	I think that , uh , too many , uh , N_S
85779:29	\[ and , \+ and \] \[ I think that , \+ I think \] 0 \[ you , \+ you \] mentioned Canada . E_S
85779:43	\[ and , \+ and \] \[ I think that , \+ I think \] 0 \[ you , \+ you \] mentioned Canada . E_S
85780:8	I think that they have a system where , uh , \[ they , \+ the government \] deals \[ with the , \+ with , \] N_S
85785:77	and that way \[ they , \+ they \] are able *-1 to reduce prices because \[ they 've , \+ \] you know , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] all \[ one , \+ one \] centralized thing . E_S
85788:28	Well , \[ I , \+ I \] think that *ICH*-3 , uh , again *-2 having gone through a period when I was out of work and had *-1 to buy health insurance on my own *T*-4 , if you do n't have a company \[ supporting you in the , \+ \] uh , picking up the major portion of your health insurance , the cost is \[ p- , \+ almost prohibitive . \] E_S
85798:8	I think 0 they were talking about the fact that , um , the money that *T*-1 could be saved *-2 , um , in administrative costs and so forth nationwide by * consolidating into sort of a national insurance provider , um , \[ could , \+ uh , could , \] N_S
85805:13	I do n't know what the total cost of the program is *T*-1 E_S
85810:17	So I assume that probably the total \[ cove- , \+ cost \] is probably , three fifty to four hundred . E_S
85810:44	So I assume that probably the total \[ cove- , \+ cost \] is probably , three fifty to four hundred . E_S
85813:11	They 're probably picking up about half of it . E_S
85823:198	or one of , whatever the type name is *T*-1 , H M O , uh , \[ where the , \+ uh , where \] you go to the doctor and it only costs you ten dollars and the insurance picks up the rest *T*-3 . If you tried *-2 to buy something like that , \[ I 'm prob- , \+ it would probably \] be five or six hundred dollars a month for just the cost of something . E_S
85839:30	but it \[ was much , \+ you know , is at least twice if not \] more expensive than the regular health care . E_S
85845:86	Uh , the reason 0 I quite *T*-2 was just because \[ \[ the , \+ the \] doctor \+ \[ a , \+ a \] certain doctor \] that we \[ en- , \+ enjoyed \] *-3 going to *T*-1 was no longer associated with that H M O E_S
85854:100	and , uh , \[ \[ I , \+ uh , I \] like the , \+ I like the \] convenience of the H M O \[ in , \+ in \] a certain respect because \[ it , \+ \] uh , even though you 're , N_S
85856:10	You know , a lot of people complain *-1 saying well , I do n't want *-4 to , uh , have *-5 to be told *-6 who I need *-2 to go to *T*-3 E_S
85857:14	but , you know , if you do n't have a doctor anyway normally it does n't really make much difference . Because you can , you know , \[ if , \+ if \] you find someone 0 you really like *T*-1 N_S
85857:84	but , you know , if you do n't have a doctor anyway normally it does n't really make much difference . Because you can , you know , \[ if , \+ if \] you find someone 0 you really like *T*-1 N_S
85865:10	and I think 0 her total bill was around three hundred dollars for everything . E_S
85869:28	Uh , that included , uh , you know , the doctors , the time , \[ the , \+ the \] hospital \[ a- , \+ an- , \] everything . Delivery room and everything . E_S
85882:56	It 's really nice because \[ \[ \[ they , \+ th- , \] \+ you know , their , \] \+ their \] attitude is different \[ than , \+ than \] a regular , uh , \[ insurance , \+ uh , health insurance , \] uh , \[ the , \+ \] \[ in , \+ in \] a , H M O , you know , E_S

85883:80	they 're trying *-1 to prevent a problem \[ by , \+ by \] *-2 keeping the cost down at the front end , you know , and have you come in , you know , E_S
85883:107	they 're trying *-1 to prevent a problem \[ by , \+ by \] *-2 keeping the cost down at the front end , you know , and have you come in , you know , E_S

85941:10	You know , \[ they , \+ they \] get \[ a lot of , \+ uh , a lot of , \] uh , people who *T*-1 \[ are \+ \] \[ j- , \+ just \] have *-2 to be there and ca n't afford it E_S
85942:28	and so \[ they , \+ they \] know 0 they 're not going *-1 to \[ get pa- , \+ you know , get money \] from them E_S
85942:73	and so \[ they , \+ they \] know 0 they 're not going *-1 to \[ get pa- , \+ you know , get money \] from them E_S
86043:33	\[ and , \+ so , \] uh , you know , in that sense * is just a little bit easier E_S

86051:14	Oh I 'm sure 0 it was wonderful . E_S
86057:34	And as always , \[ it don- , \+ it seems \] a bit , uh , rushed . E_S
86077:83	and , uh , when my father worked there *T*-1 \[ we , \+ they \] used *-2 to travel quite a bit , all around you know , \[ in , \+ in \] Europe and whatnot , E_S
86100:29	\[ but \+ so , \] Morocco I think 0 *T*-1 would be wonderful E_S
86103:33	because \[ \[ that 's , \+ you know , that 's , \] \+ that \] area of the world I think would be great . E_S
86103:75	because \[ \[ that 's , \+ you know , that 's , \] \+ that \] area of the world I think would be great . E_S
86120:45	and we had things in inside pockets and \[ in , \+ you know , in \] jacket underneath a coat type of thing . E_S
86132:49	\[ and , \+ and \] they would come up and ask you , you know , \[ if , \+ if \] you want *-1 to buy different things E_S
86137:10	you know , \[ it , \+ it 's \] a little scary too when they 're coming up and they 're all over you *T*-1 . E_S
86169:41	and you also get in *-2 to see things that you might not get into *T*-1 if you were alone , uh , E_S
86215:29	If you do n't like wildlife it 's probably not of interest . E_S
86277:24	I 've seen in , you know , N_S
86278:68	\[ they , \+ they \] show all this wonderful seafood \[ and , \+ and \] great big prawns , you know the big shrimp E_S
86286:13	I do n't think so . E_S
86292:28	it *EXP*-1 would have been , I think , much more fun * to do it like in the van , with a bunch of people . E_S
86321:27	and so I never *ICH*-1 , you know , got out by myself , or not much , E_S
86329:5	maybe it was about a thousand dollars , maybe a little bit less , E_S I do n't really remember , for ten days including all my meals , a guide , a car , the airfare E_S
86329:28	maybe it was about a thousand dollars , maybe a little bit less , E_S I do n't really remember , for ten days including all my meals , a guide , a car , the airfare E_S
86341:52	and actually then I took a train up from Shanghai to a little , Quingdao I think 0 *RNR*-1 is the name of it . E_S
86374:14	and , you know , they were newly built E_S
86406:8	I think ideally with like two couples because you have a car and a driver and a guide E_S
86421:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 I 'm kind of bent *-1 towards middle liberal of the bridge myself . E_S
86425:10	You know , I have quite a collection myself E_S
86426:14	and , you know , I 'm a good hunter E_S
86429:14	and , you know , I do n't want *-1 to see them ban guns completely E_S
86438:8	I think 0 \[ the \+ \] what was National Rifle Association , uh , had this bumper sticker *ICH*-1 a few years back \[ if , \+ uh , about 0 if \] you outlaw guns , E_S only outlaws will have guns then . E_S
86440:8	I believe that . E_S
86442:10	And I believe that too because the person that *T*-2 is wanting *-1 to , commit a crime is going *-3 to find a way 0 * to get \[ \[ a gum , \+ a gu- , \] \+ a gun , \] a knife , \[ a , \+ a \] rock , a stick , whatever it is *T*-4 , 0 * to commit a crime with *T*-5 *T*-6 , E_S
86456:28	and \[ it 's , \+ you know , it 's \] got to the point *ICH*-2 now where even \[ our , \+ our \] police departments and our D E A agents and everything have *-1 to carry automatic weapons *T*-3 E_S
86461:8	You know .
86465:55	There was \[ a \+ an \] article in the paper just this week where I think 0 it 's , uh , *ICH*-1 one of the gun companies , I ca n't remember which , was developing a \[ ten metal , \+ ten millimeter \] automatic pistol for the F B I which *T*-3 would give them additional firepower *T*-2 . E_S
86485:11	it 's sure not *?* . E_S
86518:31	You have *-1 to sign a , you know , N_S
86530:14	but , you know , any kind of handgun at all , if it will fit in a handgun and a rifle you would still have *-1 to buy it , or sign up for it , E_S
86553:8	I think that , uh , you know , \[ a , \+ a \] waiting period , uh , can make a difference E_S
86553:26	I think that , uh , you know , \[ a , \+ a \] waiting period , uh , can make a difference E_S
86563:33	So \[ there 's , \+ I do n't , think 0 there 's \] any way 0 * to control the criminal element *T*-2 as far as guns is concerned *-1 because , N_S
86568:53	\[ Th- , \+ the \] only way 0 they could do it *T*-1 I think 0 *T*-2 , would be * to stiffen the penalties on anybody using a gun . E_S
86573:10	You know , I think 0 if we kind of stiffen them up a little bit ,
86573:18	You know , I think 0 if we kind of stiffen them up a little bit ,
86575:15	anyway , E_S I think 0 if somebody shoots somebody , they ought *-1 to be shot *-1 . E_S
86585:14	but , you know . N_S
86613:53	Well and \[ the- , \+ they 're \] actually a necessity in life , you know . E_S
86617:20	They 're not , you know , E_S
86620:10	You know , whether I 'm out *-1 hunting or you know , N_S
86620:43	You know , whether I 'm out *-1 hunting or you know , N_S
86625:42	well I did in the service but \[ not , \+ you know , not \] on the street E_S
86636:28	So \[ mine are , \+ you know , I use mine \] for recreation , E_S
86648:11	Well I know what , uh , N_S
86651:13	uh , she knows how * to shoot any weapon that we have *T*-1 *T*-2
86657:22	one of these days my grandkids probably . N_S
86662:10	But I think 0 it 's , uh , N_S
86665:20	but , uh , still I think 0 they ought *-4 to know how * to use one *T*-1 and that it 's not just a toy and that \[ when , \+ \] it 's not like on T V when someone gets shot *-2 *T*-3 , uh , they get back up . E_S
86665:40	but , uh , still I think 0 they ought *-4 to know how * to use one *T*-1 and that it 's not just a toy and that \[ when , \+ \] it 's not like on T V when someone gets shot *-2 *T*-3 , uh , they get back up . E_S
86678:17	and he , you know , N_S
86684:10	You know I 've taken time *-1 to teach them E_S
86685:27	and now the young boy wants *-1 to know E_S
86686:14	and , you know , like I told him , you 're a little bit young for a gun .
86688:14	and , you know , we would start with the B B gun deal , you know , E_S
86688:49	and , you know , we would start with the B B gun deal , you know , E_S
86694:20	I said now , you know ,
86716:15	and , I was probably about twelve at the time , E_S
86720:10	and I thought 0 that was the neatest thing E_S
86728:8	I think 0 there is a lot of responsibility *ICH*-3 on any of us gun owners * to make * sure that whoever *T*-1 is around us is at least safe and knows how * to use one *T*-2 . E_S
86728:67	I think 0 there is a lot of responsibility *ICH*-3 on any of us gun owners * to make * sure that whoever *T*-1 is around us is at least safe and knows how * to use one *T*-2 . E_S
86728:105	I think 0 there is a lot of responsibility *ICH*-3 on any of us gun owners * to make * sure that whoever *T*-1 is around us is at least safe and knows how * to use one *T*-2 . E_S
86732:10	You know , I do n't want *-1 to get out there *-2 deer hunting and have some guy blow me away , E_S
86737:26	we agreed pretty well on this I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
86740:8	I think so . E_S
86756:19	The reason 0 there seems *-1 to be so much *T*-2 was the fact that the police now had advanced , uh , reporting methods , with computers and other devices . E_S
86765:77	However , I have been persuaded *-1 , lately , I guess 0 *T*-4 , simply by the , uh , overwhelming data that *T*-2 seems *-3 to be available that there is indeed a lot more violent crime . E_S
86781:10	you know , I do a lot of business here , E_S
86795:22	It just makes the whole place seem like that . E_S
86799:49	when , uh , previous secretary of , uh , educa- , Bennett , I think 0 his name was *?* , became the drug czar , uh , for , uh , President Bush *T*-3 , he was going *-2 to focus \[ on it , \+ on \] this area and do something about it E_S
86805:36	\[ What do you , \+ what do you \] think 0 *T*-1 is causing all this , E_S
86809:13	because , it seems that there N_S
86811:17	crime , though I think 0 it is increasing in number , it sure does seem *-1 to be increasing in intensity , and violence too . E_S
86811:44	crime , though I think 0 it is increasing in number , it sure does seem *-1 to be increasing in intensity , and violence too . E_S
86811:50	crime , though I think 0 it is increasing in number , it sure does seem *-1 to be increasing in intensity , and violence too . E_S
86816:51	Well , \[ I , \+ I \] have three theories about it , you know , three things . E_S
86819:26	One \[ I , \+ I \] believe that this is a function of , uh , the violence that young people see *T*-1 on television and the movies . E_S
86823:33	And , I am not just talking about , you know , uh , role models \[ of gu- , \+ of tough guys \] and gangsters and things like that , E_S
86824:50	\[ I am not even , \+ I am not even \] convinced *-3 that maybe things like football , hockey \[ and , \[ \[ \[ th- , \+ th- , \] \+ the , \] \+ you know , the , \] \+ and \] even baseball games now where \[ the , \+ \] everything is settled *-2 with a fight *T*-1 .
86824:124	\[ I am not even , \+ I am not even \] convinced *-3 that maybe things like football , hockey \[ and , \[ \[ \[ th- , \+ th- , \] \+ the , \] \+ you know , the , \] \+ and \] even baseball games now where \[ the , \+ \] everything is settled *-2 with a fight *T*-1 .
86825:10	You know , \[ the , \+ the \] immediate need * to show some sort of violence *-1 to settle \[ th- , \+ the \] argument . N_S
86829:10	so I think that particularly N_S
86831:8	I think 0 it 's Corpus Christi , that *T*-1 had the highest rates per hand gun death in America uh , per capita . E_S
86845:34	\[ That , \+ that 's \] what I think *T*-1 about it , E_S
86846:32	that 's some of the things 0 I think *T*-1 about it , E_S
86847:15	plus I do not know , E_S
86851:37	I tend *-1 to agree with you with , you know , N_S
86852:8	it seems anymore , uh , 0 a movie can not be considered *-1 good unless there 's just \[ some , \+ some \] sort of violence , or something in it . E_S
86856:37	\[ And , \+ and \] along with that , you know , N_S
86862:79	well \[ \[ that 's , \+ that 's , \] \+ that 's \] the impression 0 I get *T*-1 , you know . E_S
86866:58	\[ And I , \+ and I \] imagine that \[ it 's , \+ MUMBLEx you know , it \] just feeds upon itself when we have this sort of violence in society *T*-1 , E_S
86878:13	And I am sure that it does form role models \[ for young , \+ for young \] men and young women E_S
86883:68	uh , I mean \[ I , \+ I , \] read now where we are *T*-1 , you know , N_S
86892:8	* seems that those things \[ happened befor- , \+ \] did not happen in that manner before television . E_S
86896:65	And \[ \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I , \] \+ I \] have *-1 to think \[ that , \+ that \] it has some influence on it . E_S
86903:13	I do not know if you listen to him or not , E_S
86913:97	and they were just really coming down on him because of \[ some of the things 0 he was , \+ just some of the things \] that he believed in *T*-1 , some of his morals . E_S
86916:8	I believe in discipline '' . E_S
86921:9	You know . N_S
86926:8	it seems anymore that , uh , \[ if , \+ if \] you have , you know , this type of a moral stance , that people come down on you . E_S
86926:56	it seems anymore that , uh , \[ if , \+ if \] you have , you know , this type of a moral stance , that people come down on you . E_S
86927:21	It 's like , you know , hey , everybody has *-1 to be free *-2 to do their own thing . E_S
86929:10	and I think 0 that 's really contributing to this high rate of crime . E_S
86933:97	Well , I mean , \[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 what I wanted *-3 to say *T*-1 and I stopped , uh , I do not know , I got diverted *-2 , was \[ that , \+ that , \] uh , \[ there 's so mu- , \+ there 's so much \] of a return \[ from pris- , \+ to prison \] that the rehabilitation programs seem *-4 to be a failure . E_S
86933:228	Well , I mean , \[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 what I wanted *-3 to say *T*-1 and I stopped , uh , I do not know , I got diverted *-2 , was \[ that , \+ that , \] uh , \[ there 's so mu- , \+ there 's so much \] of a return \[ from pris- , \+ to prison \] that the rehabilitation programs seem *-4 to be a failure . E_S
86940:15	What I also think that , N_S
86942:10	you know , it does not seem *-1 to be any responsibility to the community \[ where you , \+ where you \] live *T*-2 E_S
86942:23	you know , it does not seem *-1 to be any responsibility to the community \[ where you , \+ where you \] live *T*-2 E_S
86955:28	\[ I , \+ I \] do not know how that 's , N_S
86956:13	I do not think 0 it 's done *-1 by , uh , N_S
86958:13	I do not know what it really will take *T*-1 . E_S
86962:17	And , I do not know if I have solutions , \[ except , \+ except \] 0 * to , N_S
86963:10	you know , I am sort of \[ \[ a , \+ a , \] \+ an \] advocate \[ \[ \[ of , \+ of , \] \+ uh , of * letting people , \] \+ of * having \] free speech E_S
86968:16	However , there does seem *-1 to be a , N_S
86970:11	it does seem *-1 to be a higher need for something of that sort . E_S
86977:72	How many studies *T*-2 have *-3 to be done *-4 * to show that there is a link between , you know , what you see *T*-1 and how yo- , N_S
86981:41	I mean , what you see *T*-1 affects how you think *T*-2 and therefore what you do *T*-3 . E_S
86985:13	\[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 that 's correct . E_S
86985:24	\[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 that 's correct . E_S
86988:14	but , you know , as soon as you start , uh , N_S
86992:10	And it seems to me 0 they are a \[ pretty , \+ pretty \] tough law and order state , E_S
86994:18	but yet that does not seem *-1 to have effected the amount of violent right in the state . E_S
86995:24	* Just citing that , you know . N_S
87018:35	I mean , the wives during the day , you know , get , I guess , so burned out on *-3 cooking whatever they have *-1 to cook *T*-2 every day . E_S
87021:15	Um , you know they do n't really care about gourmet stuff , E_S
87027:27	and I mean all guys , I think , like *-1 to barbecue . E_S
87028:8	I think 0 it 's caveman , E_S
87035:30	and it 's a good thing because , you know , \[ you ca n't , \+ you ca n't \] knock that . E_S
87050:23	I mean , because you know everybody is so active with their kids and all that . E_S
87051:21	It 's like , you know , if we can do it once every six months , we 're doing well . E_S
87057:36	So , I mean we originally started out , you know , when we were younger and did n't have so much stuff going on with the kids *T*-1 .
87070:83	I was involved in \[ a , \+ a \] club \[ \[ like that for , \+ um , that , \] \+ you know , where \] we tried *-1 to really do gourmet , uh , meals *T*-2 . E_S
87074:52	And , uh , \[ we , \+ we \] were a little bit too frequent I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
87081:97	so , uh , by the time 0 we got around , uh , to each of us and it was time again *T*-1 , we were almost tired , you know . Um , partly because , um , \[ wh- , \+ \] gourmet cooking is not particularly conducive for regular dining . E_S
87125:8	It sure d- , N_S
87138:33	but otherwise , um , I guess 0 , you know , entertaining , um , N_S
87145:14	so , you know , they would be pretty elaborate . E_S
87154:14	and , you know , you get all prepared E_S
87175:13	I just , think 0 it 's neat . E_S
87177:10	Oh , sure I do too . E_S
87182:65	I just love *-1 sharing meals \[ and , \+ and \] whatever you can do *T*-2 , you know , * to do that . E_S
87186:13	I do n't think 0 you have *-1 to be , you know , more than hamburgers and hot dogs *ICH*-2 out , in the backyard \[ and the , \+ and the \] coleslaw and potato salad . E_S
87186:43	I do n't think 0 you have *-1 to be , you know , more than hamburgers and hot dogs *ICH*-2 out , in the backyard \[ and the , \+ and the \] coleslaw and potato salad . E_S
87220:28	But I ca n't do it , you know , * working full-time E_S
87223:8	I know . E_S
87224:68	We 're all not built *-1 like , uh , \[ what , \+ what , \] oh , Martha Stewart , you know . E_S
87231:78	We all are n't Martha Stewart and have our coordinated glasses and tablecloths \[ and , \+ and \] time 0 * to , you know , \[ sh- , \+ t- *T*-1 , \] N_S
87240:13	I do n't know . E_S
87249:47	I mean I love *-1 to make things from scratch , you know . *-1 Making breads E_S
87256:26	\[ and , \+ and \] you know people really pretty much appreciate it . E_S
87261:13	Oh , I think so . E_S
87298:42	I mean , we have bakeries around here that , you know , \[ you , \+ you \] just gain weight *-1 going by the door *T*-2
87299:12	, you know , just like that . E_S
87308:15	but I do n't know E_S
87309:99	I guess 0 some of the best things 0 I 've ever had *T*-1 , um , \[ I , \+ \] some of them were just hors d'oeuvres , you know . E_S
87313:66	Doing little hors d'oeuvre things that , I have a kick *-1 making that *T*-2 , I mean , you know . E_S
87318:47	But um , gee , we have so much going on here because you know this is Dallas , E_S
87323:18	this is , you know , chips and Picante sauce and anything hot . E_S
87327:10	You know you can always make it hotter , \[ and , \+ and \] lots of stuff like that , you know , E_S
87327:74	You know you can always make it hotter , \[ and , \+ and \] lots of stuff like that , you know , E_S
87335:40	\[ and , \+ and \] they just love it , you know , down here . E_S
87336:31	It \[ just \+ just , \] you know , N_S
87353:13	\[ I thought , \+ I thought , \] that there was a slight difference in accent . E_S
87353:24	\[ I thought , \+ I thought , \] that there was a slight difference in accent . E_S
87397:176	And whenever the cultural revolution of nineteen forty-nine occurred *T*-1 and most churches were either banned *-2 or \[ their , \+ all the \] clergy and so forth were killed *-3 \[ or , \+ or \] imprisoned *-3 \[ or , \+ and \] the property confiscated *-4 , she was safe because she had , you know , not officially joined \[ the , \+ the \] Christian movement . E_S
87403:47	\[ and , \+ and \] he was \[ rather \+ well , you know , rather \] well *-1 to do in the old regime E_S
87405:10	You know , the bourgeoisie \[ \[ was , \+ was , \] \+ was \] \[ definitely \+ \] out of , uh , style , then . E_S
87410:119	And so they kept *-1 picking at him , picking \[ at his , \+ at her \] mother and , uh , finally , uh , started *-1 picking on her . And getting her to , you know , N_S
87416:13	Now , I think 0 I 'm leaving out a portion . E_S
87425:24	* Being a child , you know . N_S
87428:64	And , uh , \[ the , \+ the \] people kept *-1 harassing her \[ over , \+ you know , over \] a period of months E_S
87429:174	and finally they , uh , carried her , uh , out into the courtyard * \[ \[ to , \+ to , \] \+ either really to \] shoot her or to go through the motions \[ of , \+ of \] * shooting her , uh , \[ with by firing , \+ or , you know , executing her by firing \] squad . E_S
87434:53	this is not going *-1 to happen even though this lady has not really , you know , N_S
87459:10	You know , \[ they , \+ they \] stripped her of everything , practically besides \[ the , \+ the \] clothes on her back . E_S
87468:55	but yeah , she did , years later when the , uh , \[ liberalization , you know , in real life \+ liberalization of China \] happened *T*-1 , E_S
87481:13	and it was probably here and gone fairly quickly . E_S
87544:18	Of course , you know , they got married E_S
87592:9	everyone thinks 0 taxes are too high I 'm sure 0 *T*-1 . E_S
87592:33	everyone thinks 0 taxes are too high I 'm sure 0 *T*-1 . E_S
87593:17	But , uh , I think 0 we do get quite a good value for the tax dollars 0 we spend *T*-1 in most cases . E_S
87594:14	What do you think *T*-1 ? E_S
87597:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think so . E_S

88029:10	You know \[ on the , \+ on the \] broad scope I mean , um , like if , uh , \[ \[ it , \+ it , \] \+ it \] had a much bigger thing I thin- , N_S meaning to me N_S I think about , you know , just the meaning of , um , the freedom of this country \[ and , \+ and \] what that really meant *T*-1 .

88040:10	And I thought 0 Kevin Costner was just , N_S
88043:8	I know the , N_S
88045:25	but he 's the director , you know . E_S
88047:26	\[ I , \+ I \] just thought 0 it was a really interesting , intense film . E_S
88051:11	Intense I think 0 *T*-1 is the word for it because three hours went by really fast . E_S
88062:13	I do n't know why . E_S
88073:20	So we decided 0 that may be the mark of a good film . E_S
88074:15	It made us think . E_S
88077:15	It made you think . E_S
88082:26	\[ Maybe i- , \+ well , maybe that \] was , um , N_S
88085:25	but there are no answers , you know . E_S
88087:8	I know E_S
88108:19	and , um , you know , when the truth ,
88135:73	Um , I rented a good movie , um , called * CINEMA PARADESO which *T*-1 is an Italian movie which *T*-3 is probably the best movie 0 I 've seen *T*-2 ever . E_S
88158:8	I thought 0 I had *-1 to kind of get beyond that . E_S
88161:16	Those little , you know , N_S
88200:37	\[ it 's , \+ it 's , \] you know , N_S
88205:21	I 'm guessing 0 you probably do . E_S
88257:10	Oh , sure . E_S
88297:15	so I 'm not sure that we 'll be able *-1 to \[ do , \+ get \] too many other programs for it . E_S
88304:8	I thought 0 I had died and gone to heaven because , I thought , oh , they 're so wonderful . E_S
88304:45	I thought 0 I had died and gone to heaven because , I thought , oh , they 're so wonderful . E_S
88355:11	That 's probably where you 've used it *T*-1 . E_S
88364:83	and it *ICH*-1 was just so nice * to be able just *-2 to step into the position \[ and , \+ and \] \[ already know the langu- , \+ you know , already know \[ the , \+ the \] software . \] E_S
88364:101	and it *ICH*-1 was just so nice * to be able just *-2 to step into the position \[ and , \+ and \] \[ already know the langu- , \+ you know , already know \[ the , \+ the \] software . \] E_S

88365:22	And , um , I do n't know from my own experience , um , E_S
88367:8	It may be improved by now E_S
88374:18	I mean you know , you , N_S
88375:54	some of the commands just had nothing 0 * to do *T*-4 with , you know , \[ what you were supposed *-2 to be doing *T*-3 \+ \[ what they , \+ what they \] did *T*-1 on the \[ com- , \+ computer \] \] E_S
88381:15	just , you know , * did n't match with the kinds of keys , 0 you were using *T*-1 . E_S
88401:77	and \[ if you add it , \+ if you put a footnote \] \[ in , \+ in \] the middle , you know , if you come up with some new piece of documentation and you put that in the middle of your paper and have *-1 to footnote it , \[ you just change , \+ um , it just automatically changes \] all your footnoting numbers for you . E_S
88405:14	So , you know , it 's just , N_S
88413:10	And I think about how it used *-1 to be *T*-3 if you were doing a paper and you had *-2 to go back and retype everything , E_S
88415:22	So , um , I do n't know 0 I think 0 we have just become really spoiled . E_S
88415:32	So , um , I do n't know 0 I think 0 we have just become really spoiled . E_S
88416:10	But I think , 0 it 's a nice kind of way 0 * to be spoiled *T*-1 . E_S
88428:11	although I think 0 we 've probably been talking at least ten minutes N_S
88428:24	although I think 0 we 've probably been talking at least ten minutes N_S
88448:10	Oh , sure . E_S
88480:28	but \[ I , \+ I \] just know right now that I could n't have put out half of what I did *T*-1 if that much without the being in computers E_S
88510:28	Well , those are skills that she certainly \[ w- , \+ is \] going *-1 to need *T*-2 early on E_S
88511:19	\[ and , you know , the , \+ and it \] seems like it 's getting earlier and earlier with the children . E_S
88511:40	\[ and , you know , the , \+ and it \] seems like it 's getting earlier and earlier with the children . E_S
88515:17	So , um , I think that that would be \[ a real , \+ a real , \] uh , advantage \[ to , \+ to \] her *-1 to have that and , uh , do it early , E_S
88528:97	\[ And so I , \+ and I \] wanted her to put it into the computer , and then print it out and , make a book with it , you know . E_S
88557:34	This is really going *-1 to be fun I think 0 *T*-2 , E_S
88562:10	and I think about all the people that he talks to *T*-1 all over the , N_S
88592:13	Uh , I think 0 that 's really a decision \[ th- , \+ that , \] N_S
88597:43	well , * help them make *?* in terms of , you know , what \[ they are , \+ they are \] wanting *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S
88604:10	You know , \[ that , \+ that 's \] a big influence , I think 0 *T*-1
88604:49	You know , \[ that , \+ that 's \] a big influence , I think 0 *T*-1
88605:14	and , You know \[ what , \+ not only what \] you can afford *T*-3 , but \[ what , \+ what *T*-1 's \] going *-2 to be best for them in terms of what their career goals are *T*-4 . E_S
88616:19	So , uh , you know , you need *-1 to go to a school that *T*-2 handles whatever it is *T*-3 0 you want *-4 to do *T*-5 . E_S
88640:38	Uh , well , at the time , I was , uh , thinking of *-1 going pre med E_S
88675:66	when you said 0 it was \[ quite a , \+ quite a \] way away *T*-2 , I did not know 0 \[ it \+ that \] meant 0 you had *-1 to drive like an hour E_S
88683:31	* did not get home that often , you know , E_S
88706:19	And , uh , you know , I guess , you know , 0 when you have *-1 to do it that way *T*-2 , it \[ makes , \+ makes \] your choices a lot easier E_S

88711:36	\[ that , \+ that 's \] like , you know , when I went on *-1 to get \[ my , \+ my \] master 's *T*-2 \[ I , uh , basically was , \+ you know , it was where I was *T*-3 \] at the time . E_S

88718:10	You know , I was not going *-1 to try *-2 to pick *ICH*-3 and go somewhere else because I was pretty much settled E_S
88774:23	I , have not MUMBLEx you know , N_S
88775:42	there 's a lot of pluses and minuses for different schools , you know , just like you said . E_S
88777:51	so \[ I , \+ I \] have not really made up my mind , you know , whether *-1 to encourage them to go different places E_S
88783:38	One day I would like *-1 to , uh , you know , the , uh , N_S
88803:22	Uh , but , uh , you know , that , I 'm not going *-1 to hold them to that just because I went there . E_S
88807:15	I , you know , think 0 that 's N_S
88807:20	I , you know , think 0 that 's N_S
88825:13	I did n't know that . E_S
88827:8	Well certain schools do it . E_S
88840:108	Uh , and it was kind of fun , because you are \[ trying * \[ to \+ to , \] \+ trying *-1 to \] get people interested in your school , you know . E_S
88850:33	And there were a bunch of kids , you know , and a bunch of schools . E_S
88851:21	There were a hundred schools , probably there all competing for the same kids . E_S
88858:73	It *EXP*-1 's kind of interesting * \[ \[ to , \+ to , \] \+ to \] talk up , you know , your , school E_S
88863:81	And , I was surprised by the number of kids that *T*-1 \[ came , \+ came \] by and had heard of , you know , our school . \[ And , \+ and \] were interested in it . E_S
88870:15	Uh , you know , we , uh , MUMBLEx N_S
88871:35	situations like that , you do n't realize , you know , until you start *-1 thinking about it , the kinds of MUMBLEx advantages 0 you school may have *T*-2 over others . E_S

88882:8	I think so . E_S
88885:13	I do n't know offhand E_S
88886:17	but , uh , it seemed like there were quite a few kids that *T*-1 were definitely interested in *-2 going there . E_S
88895:147	But \[ she was , \+ \[ her , \+ her \] daughter was , \] uh , \[ \[ \[ a , \+ a , \] \+ \[ \[ ma- , \+ ma- , \] \+ dru- , \] a \] majorette or something . \+ You know , a baton twirler or something \] E_S

88915:8	I think 0 some parents go a little bit overboard . E_S
88922:13	Well you know I think 0 Richardson is probably you know one of the places that *T*-1 would definitely N_S
88922:19	Well you know I think 0 Richardson is probably you know one of the places that *T*-1 would definitely N_S
88922:32	Well you know I think 0 Richardson is probably you know one of the places that *T*-1 would definitely N_S
88922:40	Well you know I think 0 Richardson is probably you know one of the places that *T*-1 would definitely N_S
88926:29	Oh , \[ I gue- , \+ I think \] 0 we rented PRETTY WOMAN a couple \[ weeks , \+ months \] ago . E_S
88947:29	kind of gory and lots of , you know action . E_S
88953:13	I do n't know if I have even heard of that one . E_S
88955:15	Um , do you know that I do n't follow performers , E_S
88960:11	Some I know , E_S
88982:34	\[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] know what his name is *T*-1 . E_S
88984:13	Uh , I think 0 I know who you are talking about *T*-1 though . E_S
88984:23	Uh , I think 0 I know who you are talking about *T*-1 though . E_S
88994:43	\[ \[ it was , \+ it was \] \+ you know , a lot of people said 0 it was \] a really funny movie , E_S
89009:26	Oh , I 'm trying *-1 to think , uh , E_S
89023:44	but then when it started *T*-1 , I just could n't , you know , read . E_S
89026:8	It sure was *?* . E_S
89027:14	And , you know , the second time 0 you see it *T*-1 , you understand more subtleties in it . E_S
89062:15	There 's nothing wrong with that . E_S
89076:92	now I was WARLOCK *ICH*-5 too , which *T*-1 is supposed *-2 to be the story of a , uh , witch hunt that *T*-3 is , you know , magically shot *-4 into the present time . E_S
89112:8	I think 0 you said Peter . E_S
89123:32	Even when he 's sad *T*-1 , you know , you great faith that he will get happy again . E_S
89139:15	Well , you know , I think 0 I read about that too . E_S
89139:23	Well , you know , I think 0 I read about that too . E_S
89143:8	I think 0 it 's time 0 we had a lady abuse the guys movie *T*-1 . E_S
89172:21	I was trying *-1 to think of the other one that we had rented *T*-2 lately , uh ,
89178:12	And , I thought 0 that was really good . E_S
89180:10	You know , I saw that E_S
89205:8	I think 0 he ought *-1 to stay Indiana Jones . E_S
89210:13	I do n't know E_S
89217:30	but he was always slick , and greasy , and seemed *-1 to be conceited and had more women than he needed *?* E_S
89222:8	I thought 0 he looked real good with a beard , too . E_S
89228:13	I do n't know , uh , E_S
89229:8	I think 0 that beard gives him a look that he is always grinning , whether he is *?* or not *T*-1 . E_S
89240:21	I 'm trying *-1 to think . E_S
89266:12	and someday , maybe , we might even own it , E_S
89266:20	and someday , maybe , we might even own it , E_S
89286:30	Before that we lived in Garland , uh , probably about , you know , four blocks away . E_S
89286:45	Before that we lived in Garland , uh , probably about , you know , four blocks away . E_S
89292:13	I do n't know if you have been up here , E_S
89298:32	So , there 's a lot of , you know , activities , a lot of pluses and common land . E_S
89299:17	But , uh , we thought 0 we were buying at the bottom of the market , you know , E_S
89299:57	But , uh , we thought 0 we were buying at the bottom of the market , you know , E_S
89301:16	and so we were wrong . E_S
89309:8	I think , N_S
89316:45	I would give it two years back , when it was , I think 0 *T*-2 , bottomed out *T*-1 . E_S
89318:24	Oddly enough , two years , you know , E_S
89319:28	\[ I , \+ uh , I \] think that , N_S
89321:9	But , maybe not in your area , E_S
89331:37	Besides , \[ \[ it 's , \+ you know , it 's not , \] \+ it 's not \] Richardson . Is it *?* ? E_S
89365:13	I do n't think that many by the builder that *T*-1 built this house . E_S
89367:8	I think 0 we are the third owners . E_S
89384:32	\[ I , \+ I , \] kept *-1 thinking of Omar Sharif every time 0 I saw that name somewhere *T*-2 , E_S
89390:8	I think 0 he got out of the lower end market . And decided , N_S
89399:18	well but , still I know that this one was built *-1 for two ninety nine , which *T*-2 is nowhere near what we paid *T*-3 for it . E_S
89403:10	And I think 0 somebody told me 0 it 's also on a creek side lot , heavily wooded off the golf course . E_S
89420:8	I think 0 it was sixty , eighty . E_S
89424:8	I think . E_S
89426:16	Well because , I know 0 \[ our , \+ our \] little house over here stuck * in the middle of , you know , the subdivision is , I think fifty five , E_S
89426:77	Well because , I know 0 \[ our , \+ our \] little house over here stuck * in the middle of , you know , the subdivision is , I think fifty five , E_S
89426:97	Well because , I know 0 \[ our , \+ our \] little house over here stuck * in the middle of , you know , the subdivision is , I think fifty five , E_S
89427:12	so , I think 0 the high end is definitely , you know somewhere there . E_S
89427:39	so , I think 0 the high end is definitely , you know somewhere there . E_S
89429:19	Well , * try and think if it was a hundred dollars a square foot . E_S
89441:10	Now , maybe , you know , that 's pretty close to what it would have sold for *T*-1 , uh , * brand new , E_S
89441:20	Now , maybe , you know , that 's pretty close to what it would have sold for *T*-1 , uh , * brand new , E_S
89444:14	but , you know , \[ I do n't think , \+ I think \] 0 it 's going *-1 to be a long time , if ever , when nice things and really quality construction and all the other additional amenities are really , uh , desirable *T*-2 . E_S

89445:12	It 's seems like people go for square footage only now E_S
89457:8	I think 0 those are awful . E_S
89460:59	I just see him as * trying *-1 to squish \[ as much space , \+ you know , as much house into the space \] as possible . E_S
89467:21	They are *?* , you know , E_S
89480:10	And we thought 0 that was important instead of * getting swallowed up in something that you know . N_S
89480:61	And we thought 0 that was important instead of * getting swallowed up in something that you know . N_S
89490:8	I know somebody who *T*-1 lives back there , E_S
89492:30	and \[ I , \+ I \] do n't think 0 they exceed more than twelve nails per house . E_S
89506:20	I mean , you know , you pay for it too , E_S
89534:28	and \[ they are , \+ you know , they are \] used to the Virginia area , metropolitan D C . E_S
89547:103	And , uh , the idea of * ever owning anything that *T*-1 has four thousand square feet in it , for less than two hundred twenty thousand dollars , which *T*-2 is probably about what their equity *ICH*-6 is *T*-3 , that they got *T*-4 out of *-5 selling their house . E_S
89559:10	And I thought , N_S
89566:13	And I was thinking , well , you know , I know why your God damn bill is so high *T*-1 , E_S

89580:75	\[ \[ they , \+ they \] show very well un- , \+ they show very well unless \] you have , you know , lived in a lot of houses around the area , or looked at a lot of houses around here . E_S

89594:8	I think 0 if we had *-1 to sell now , we could come close to * breaking even . E_S

89659:10	You know , \[ th- , \+ so there \] are \[ a lot of , \+ a lot \] of activities going on all the time E_S

89901:14	and , you know , it does not have a real story , or any plot , E_S
89922:95	he wrote , uh , sort of *-1 debunking many of \[ the , \+ uh , uh , MUMBLEx the \] stories about the , uh , Bermuda Triangle . You know , E_S
89923:26	\[ he , \+ he \] was thinking 0 \[ \[ many , \+ many \] of \[ the \+ the \] myths , \+ many of the myths \] of the triangle \[ were , \+ uh , actually , could be \] explained *-1 , E_S

E_S
89931:15	And I do n't know if you are familiar with that at all E_S
89944:39	\[ And so , \+ and \] in the book , you know , even , N_S
89946:77	\[ and even , \+ and even \] then \[ he , \+ he \] had a very good case for the fact 0 they probably just got lost *-1 and they ditched in the water . E_S

89951:42	On that same topic , have you ever read anything about , you know , the Amelia Earhart story , whatever *T*-1 happened with her ? E_S
89956:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 that would be , N_S
89957:11	I am sure 0 there is something out there , uh , MUMBLEx , E_S
89961:57	because it 's a lot of things *ICH*-1 coming up here lately about her , you know , possibilities \[ of he- , \+ of where she \] MUMBLEx , N_S
89963:8	I thought 0 she was a prisoner of war or something for like ten years . E_S
89972:18	Of course , you know , it is so weird , E_S
89973:22	cause no one will ever really know , E_S
89976:17	and it makes you think about things . E_S
89980:14	That is for sure . E_S
89994:73	I mean , usually , \[ I just , \+ if I \] find a good book , I will sit , you know , for two days until it is finished *-1 . If it 's that good , E_S
89998:10	and I think 0 the last one 0 I read *T*-1 like that was Scott Thurow 's E_S
90011:20	My , uh , you know , N_S
90017:71	and \[ she had , \+ before it actually got big , she sent \] me this book *-1 saying , you might like this , E_S
90018:20	this guy is , you know , from here . E_S
90027:20	That was good , I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S

90032:10	and I think 0 I did read Tom Wolfe and VANITY , uh , E_S
90059:54	I mean , because Tom Wolfe is so perceptive , when it comes to , you know , * pinpointing , uh , \[ \[ so- , \+ so- , \] \+ society 's \] ills and , things like that and just nailing people to the wall and exposing things *T*-1 E_S
90071:8	I know . E_S
90089:41	but I have not been able *-1 to *?* yet , you know , for one reason or another . E_S
90092:10	you know I have a list too E_S
90096:62	cause \[ I just kind of , \+ uh , I just \] have all the books out , you know , E_S
90130:20	I mean , you know , \[ he just , \+ He 's \] being helped *-1 . E_S
90143:26	\[ I , \+ I \] just thought 0 that was so neat , that they got him over that hump . E_S
90145:13	I do n't know if you 're , familiar with that . E_S
90158:8	I think 0 I read about that in the paper . E_S
90169:14	And , you know , \[ in , \+ in \] * watching the way 0 he has struggled *T*-1 , E_S
90183:45	\[ And , \+ and so \] \[ it 's , \+ you know , it 's \] not an intelligence problem . E_S
90187:18	or is this something that maybe * learning phonetics , E_S
90190:15	Well , you know , it 's funny . E_S
90196:10	you know , it 's amazing . E_S
90199:14	and , you know , he 'll say C A T , E_S
90205:37	And I kept *-1 saying to the teacher , something is wrong here . E_S
90206:11	Something is wrong here . E_S
90228:20	and I said , you know , something is wrong , E_S
90228:32	and I said , you know , something is wrong , E_S
90243:20	And she said , you know , \[ we , \+ we \] were going *-1 to call you if you had n't called us . E_S
90244:8	We think 0 there 's a learning disability E_S
90245:10	and we think 0 he needs *-1 to be tested *-2 immediately , because , you know , once the first report card comes in , they , have all these people being tested * , E_S

90249:19	and she said , I think 0 we can get him real fast . E_S
90254:7	And sure enough , they tested him E_S
90255:14	and , you know , he qualified \[ for , \+ for \] the help , E_S
90257:71	\[ and I , \+ and I \] thank God 0 I 'm here , because \[ I , \+ I \] know 0 I have a sister who *T*-1 has the other extreme . E_S
90275:32	but that 's something that parents , I think 0 *T*-2 , are able *-1 to help the gifted child in the home more than they could help the learning disabled child *T*-3 . E_S
90300:15	and I 'm not sure that the private schools or parochial schools address that problem ,
90341:10	I know recently I was in a discussion E_S
90350:10	You know , you ca n't say , um , you know ,
90350:38	You know , you ca n't say , um , you know ,
90351:8	I know 0 Steven probably would not be accepted *-1 because he has a learning disability \[ and , \+ \] into a private school . \[ And , \+ \] um , \[ which *T*-3 is , \+ which *T*-2 is \] too bad . E_S
90351:18	I know 0 Steven probably would not be accepted *-1 because he has a learning disability \[ and , \+ \] into a private school . \[ And , \+ \] um , \[ which *T*-3 is , \+ which *T*-2 is \] too bad . E_S
90355:58	But on the other hand , \[ I , \+ I \] ca n't necessarily blame them , you know ,
90377:100	If you choose the select top group out of the public schools and tested them , and then compared them \[ to the pri- , \+ to the private \] school group , then I think 0 you would have a more equitable way . E_S
90388:117	\[ the , \+ \] in fact , they 've had cases *ICH*-1 in the past where parents have committed suicide because their child has not gotten into the top kindergarten , which *T*-2 means 0 they probably wo n't get into the top elementary \[ and , \+ and \] high school *T*-3 , E_S
90392:53	and if they do n't , \[ then af- , \+ \] when they reach a certain age *T*-1 , \[ they just , \+ \] that 's the end of their schooling . E_S
90416:93	Um , \[ I , \+ I \] was talking to somebody recently or read somewhere \[ where they , \+ where they \] said that , you know , these children , \[ they , \+ they \] had *-2 to be the best *T*-1 , E_S
90417:38	and they put off all social life , all everything , you know . E_S
90425:95	but on the other hand , I feel like my children , who *T*-1 are kind of middle of the road , \[ have , \+ are \] more rounded , you know . E_S
90433:4	sure , E_S
90434:8	I think 0 it *EXP*-1 's real important * to have friends . E_S
90435:8	I think 0 it *EXP*-1 's real important * to play sports . E_S
90436:8	I think 0 it *EXP*-1 's real important * to be part of a team . E_S
90441:26	We did n't do all that you know . E_S
90445:8	We certainly did n't carpool and run the way 0 I do *T*-1 .
90545:165	But I am going *-1 \[ to , \+ to , \] uh , hopefully next year get *-2 to go back , cause , uh , a lot of the family \[ has not , \+ uh , on \[ her side , \+ my mother 's side , \] has not \] seen , you know , my daughter , E_S
90590:20	and at time , you know , they all knew one another . E_S
90596:14	or , you know , what we are left *-2 with *T*-1 is \[ the , \+ the \] relatives \[ \[ of , \+ of , \] \+ of \] that group . E_S
90602:12	So , I think 0 people feel less of a desire * to really go . E_S
90603:8	I know that , N_S
90605:29	\[ Wh- , \+ why \] do you think that it 's less close than it used *-1 to be *?* *T*-2 ? E_S
90607:31	Well , \[ I , \+ I \] just think \[ that , \+ uh , you know , at that \] ti- , N_S
90607:55	Well , \[ I , \+ I \] just think \[ that , \+ uh , you know , at that \] ti- , N_S
90609:10	you know , \[ the , \+ those \] were all brothers and sisters a lot N_S
90616:10	You know , back around , you know , in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up *T*-1 , uh , you know , they were all located *-2 together , in one small community . E_S

90625:62	And now when they come together *T*-1 \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] generally , you know , N_S
90626:45	like say the kids of those people who *T*-1 are not , you know , anywhere near one another
90627:15	and I do not think 0 they feel \[ the , \+ the \] closeness that they *T*-3 used *-4 to be there . Which *T*-2 is a shame E_S
90632:34	My mother was complaining last year about th- , you know , N_S

90634:37	you know , \[ that 's just , \+ I think 0 that 's just \] , N_S
90636:44	Is that \[ just \+ \] family 's lack of priority , anymore , maybe
90648:8	I think 0 that 's some of it . E_S
90649:14	But , you know , I have , N_S
90651:28	it 's just the way , you know , 0 I think 0 society is *T*-1 now , is that \[ we are not , \+ we do not \] have the extensive family 0 we used *-2 to *?* *T*-3 . E_S

90655:35	It 's more of \[ a , \+ you know , a \] \[ smaller , \+ smaller \] unit , E_S
90656:12	and you know , \[ we , \+ we \] tend *-1 to try *-2 to do things , I think 0 *T*-5 with our immediate family , as opposed to the extended family . Of people that we may *RNR*-4 or may not *RNR*-4 remember or know *T*-3 , you know , very well . E_S

90771:10	So you probably could give some great advice . E_S
90773:23	Uh , well , I do n't know about that , E_S

90798:10	And I think 0 that 's one reason why I 'm part of this study *T*-1 , uh , because \[ it 's of , \+ \] I 'm working with voice systems . E_S

91687:46	Well , we try *-1 to stay away from those things which *T*-2 might have , uh , salmonella in them . E_S
91713:60	Do they always have \[ the , \+ the \] one person in the family who \[ * knows , or \+ everyone thinks 0 *T*-4 they know \] how * to make this the best *T*-3 , so that 's what they get *-1 to cook *T*-2 . E_S

91854:8	I think 0 that 's what *T*-1 happens when they get scattered *T*-2 , E_S
91855:34	\[ the , \+ the \] family unit , you know , falls , into disrepair . E_S

93324:8	I think 0 when we went to England and France *T*-1 , we were there ten , twelve days , E_S
93375:8	I think 0 if they could get tourists coming to their country , they 'd improve the economy considerably . E_S

93377:27	Huh . Well , \[ may , \+ maybe \] now 0 things are calming down again . That will happen . E_S
93425:17	not every morning , it probably averages about two days a week E_S

93487:36	So , I 'm thirty-two years old which *T*-1 is probably different than yourself E_S
93514:58	so even though I can look at it as a task , \[ the , \+ \] you know , \[ I kind of get the , \+ I get some kind of \] global benefit from the whole thing by *-1 saying , Well , I 'm lowering my chance of heart attack , and \[ thus , \+ that \] type stuff . E_S

93563:52	so , running , \[ I , \+ I 'm \] at that point which you probably get to *T*-1 after about six months of dedicated running where you do n't feel your muscles any more *T*-2 E_S
93570:15	and you do n't think about the pain of it . E_S
93572:10	and you think about other things . E_S
93573:30	During those first few months you have *-1 to think about running and why your elbow hurts *T*-2 and why you ca n't breathe *T*-3 and this and that , E_S
93585:59	\[ the ex- , \+ the , uh , weight lifting \] on the other hand is actually , you know , N_S

93630:44	that 's something that *T*-1 comes with time , too . You know , E_S
93635:32	the sit ups and push ups are excellent you know , E_S

93721:43	And , uh , \[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] think 0 you should worry about *-1 not having a program yet . E_S
93736:13	Well , I think 0 we covered it . E_S
93755:108	well , \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] guess 0 if I was having a dinner party \[ I , \+ depending on the number of people , I \] might cook \[ a , \+ like a \] brisket or a roast or \[ a , \+ maybe a \] chicken dish E_S

93946:13	\[ I thought , \+ oh , *-2 \[ taking this , \+ you know , taking this \] as a dip , I thought , \] gosh , you know , sometimes when we have it at home *T*-1 it , it turns dark on the top so quickly , E_S

94486:55	like you said , you have the drug problem and just the general atmosphere where you 're pressured *-1 not to learn *T*-2 in instance , E_S
94489:15	well , you know , in a lot of cases like that , where , you know , if kids are going to a public parochial school like that , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] because the parents are more interested in them receiving an education .

94492:14	and , uh , maybe they pick up on that . E_S
94496:27	And then from the other aspect , um , maybe the , uh , school itself \[ \[ has , \+ has , \] \+ has \] more emphasis on , uh , *-1 trying *-2 to do a good job because the classes may be smaller , uh , E_S

94751:13	Well , I know that when my youngsters were small *T*-1 , N_S
94805:76	I mean a lot of people do it really the reverse and go to work after the children are in school , you know . E_S
94807:8	I know . E_S
94825:79	and when he started , uh , at Skyline High School *T*-2 , I asked him , Son , \[ when , \+ uh , you know , where \] do I go *-1 to sign up for the P T A *T*-3 ? E_S
94849:25	and I could n't just , you know , wait for \[ eight , \+ three \] or four months and then bring them back to her E_S
94868:47	and , uh , the children were left *-1 unattended in a room , you know , E_S
94897:144	and in one particular case they had a summer program where they were *-1 to be taken *-2 to the Y and taught *-2 *-2 to swim which *T*-3 just pleased me to death because I 've always \[ been , ha- , \+ you know , been afraid \] of the water *T*-4 E_S

94985:16	three eight six twenty-five C maybe E_S
94986:13	I do n't know , E_S
95024:10	do you know Latek ? \[ Wo- , \+ Word \] text processing , E_S
95080:8	I think 0 that 's the thirty second warning . E_S
95087:58	Oh , that 's \[ a , \+ an \] ambulance or something going on here , I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
95106:94	So it 'd be interesting for the people that *T*-1 look at this signal I mean , because there 's a lot of background noise that , you know , people can hear *T*-2 . E_S
95128:13	Uh , I know someone who *T*-1 has *?* , E_S
95143:13	I do n't know too much about it . E_S
95177:16	Well , it 's probably the granddaddy of most , uh , data base management systems . E_S
95183:27	so , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 by now , it 's a matter of , uh , personal taste . E_S
95193:17	and both of those seem very easy 0 * to use *T*-1 compared to D Base . E_S
95196:10	Do you think 0 \[ you \+ \] D Base is more flexible or allows you to do more . E_S
95197:12	Or do you think 0 the others are pretty much compatible these days ? E_S
95200:7	but certainly comparable . E_S
95230:70	and that gives me the opportunity * to , uh , come in to work and fix it , if I ca n't think of some thing 0 * to tell the trouble shooter *T*-1 while we 're on the phone . E_S
95238:14	What do you think *T*-1 about it ? E_S
95240:88	Well , \[ I , \+ I \] feel in light of some of the accidents and so forth that *T*-1 have happened lately , that I think 0 there are some occupations \[ that they should , \+ \] such as the health field , the transportation field , uh , N_S
95247:10	and I think 0 \[ if , \+ if , \] uh , an employer feels that he wants *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] drug test employees and they do n't like it , then they should not be employed *-2 there . E_S
95249:10	you know , I would not mind it . E_S
95252:77	\[ I , \+ I \] especially agree that if it 's an area where they could cause somebody else , you know harm or injury *T*-1 , absolutely . E_S
95259:13	I do n't know , E_S
95260:11	sometimes I think 0 they carry it a little bit too far . E_S
95266:28	unless an employer has a reason *-1 to believe that \[ his , \+ \] uh , the work competency \[ of , \+ of \] the \[ employ- , \+ employee \] \[ is , \+ is \] hurting the business . E_S
95273:13	I mean maybe it 's , uh , N_S

95301:38	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] think 0 they should screen for alcohol in these areas , too because I consider that a drug . E_S
95307:17	and that , I think , is even probably more widely *ICH*-2 abused *-1 by , you know , the masses \[ than , \+ than \] drugs , so * to speak . E_S

95344:28	\[ and , \+ and , \] you know , our names or our employee numbers or whatever are \[ in a , \+ in a \] pool E_S
95358:10	and I think 0 that 's the only reason 0 I have a problem with it *T*-1 , when \[ there 's no , \+ you know , there 's no \] reason 0 * to suspect someone *T*-2 *T*-3 , you know . E_S

95366:70	Well , as long as you accept that it is \[ a random , \+ a random \] testing uh , you know , * \[ to , \+ to \] alleviate , N_S
95379:10	You know , so your name came out of pot when they spun the wheel *T*-1 , E_S
95384:59	\[ I would , \+ I would \] rather *ICH*-2 have it that way , * to know that I was chosen *-1 at random by a computer than * to think that somebody turned me in because \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 \[ there 's , \+ \] when you let other employees turn in people *T*-3 , N_S

95398:51	So , \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] would really rather know , however , E_S
95400:82	\[ if , \+ if \] somebody does observe you \[ at , \+ say at \] a party , uh , using drugs I would think that it *EXP*-1 would be their obligation * to report that . E_S

95419:13	I do n't know what kind of work you do *T*-1 , E_S

95440:32	\[ \[ I , \+ I \] just think 0 employers have *-1 to have , \+ * especially given today , the drug abuse that *T*-2 goes on , I just think 0 employers have *-3 to have \] some kind of way 0 * to see that they 're not being put *-7 at risk *T*-6 .

95519:13	I do n't believe that . E_S
95521:8	I think that an employer has the right * to ask you *-1 to do anything , E_S
95534:10	and I probably \[ re- , \+ rebelled \] against it . E_S
95537:8	I probably should have kept one . E_S
95546:57	and I sort of just got in the habit , I guess 0 *T*-1 . And , you know , never have gotten out of it . E_S
95548:109	it 's more just \[ \[ a , \+ a pretty , \] \+ uh , a fairly , \] uh , accurate , uh , recording of what I spend *T*-1 , and what I think 0 I am going *-2 to have *-3 to spend *T*-4 . E_S
95554:8	I think 0 it makes much more sense , E_S

95566:137	I just , uh , spent whatever *T*-1 came in \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , \[ didn- , \+ never knew \] what *T*-2 came in and what *T*-3 went out . But , uh , \[ just , you know , like , \+ about like \] the government runs . E_S
95577:12	So , I think 0 it *EXP*-1 is probably better * to have some sort of \[ \[ a , \+ a , \] \+ at least a \] record E_S

95615:13	I could not believe 0 he did that , E_S
95635:105	I guess 0 \[ it would have been , \+ I will take that back , it must have been \] in the forties , because they had been married , uh , probably fifteen years at the time . E_S

96057:17	and , uh , I think 0 it 's going *-1 to cost us , per couple , about three hundred dollars for the week . E_S
96063:40	because , uh , \[ the , \+ \] uh , you know , it has got its own \[ kitchen , \+ full size , kitchen \] and everything . E_S
96067:21	And , this one , I think 0 *T*-1 has two baths , E_S
96076:10	you know , it 's really a nice stay .
96108:48	it will take , uh , a day and a half * to get there , probably . E_S
96152:30	\[ so , \+ anyway , so \] \[ maybe , \+ maybe \] within a year , we will see how that falls *T*-1 . E_S

96156:47	\[ We will head for , \+ we will head for \] Florida , maybe in somewhat of an off season , instead of summer . E_S

96180:30	\[ Or , \+ or \] what do you think *T*-1 ? E_S
96185:8	I think so . E_S
96191:8	I think 0 there 's still a lot 0 *T*-1 to be made *-2 , though . E_S
96195:8	I think so . E_S
96210:42	well , uh , have there been significant changes , uh , do you think in the employment place , \[ ex- , \+ especially , \] uh , say at T I . E_S
96245:22	in years past , I know 0 *T*-1 , in fact , \[ even , \+ even \] the word drafter has changed , E_S
96258:10	But I thought , well I am , not going *-1 to do that . E_S
96275:83	So , I was in a lot of classes where , uh , \[ there , \+ I \] was either the only girl or , you know , one of just a very , few women in the class *T*-1 . E_S
96301:24	\[ And , \+ and \] I think that , uh , you know , the one thing that I have seen *T*-1 is that more and more women are getting into management , E_S
96301:42	\[ And , \+ and \] I think that , uh , you know , the one thing that I have seen *T*-1 is that more and more women are getting into management , E_S
96304:10	but I think 0 they have got a long way 0 *-2 to go *T*-3 . E_S
96316:10	And I thought that , you know , that 's \[ pretty si- , \+ a pretty significantly \] small number . E_S
96316:23	And I thought that , you know , that 's \[ pretty si- , \+ a pretty significantly \] small number . E_S
96325:22	But , uh , I do not know , E_S
96326:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 we have come a long way , actually , when I think about , you know , when things were like even , \[ when I , \+ you know , just when I \] was in high school *T*-4 *T*-3 , and how it is *T*-1 now for girls *T*-2 . E_S

96339:160	And , uh , uh , I guess 0 \[ \[ \[ my , \+ I , \] uh , the one , \] \+ my one \] bad thing is \[ that I am , \+ that I wish \] 0 my mother had had some of those opportunities , because , I think 0 \[ she would have really , \+ she rea- , would have \] succeeded in a lot of ways , \[ that men , \+ that women \] were not able *-1 to succeed *T*-2 , in her , generation . E_S
96371:74	So , \[ she is pretty much , \+ although there were some other women in her class , she was , \] you know , uh , one of the minorities ,
96387:33	\[ But , \+ uh , But , \] you know , MUMBLEx for instance \[ there are , \+ there is \] the organization \[ women , \+ the Society of Women \] MUMBLEx Engineers , E_S
96394:38	so , that is recognized *-2 , as , uh , you know , a place where women should be *T*-1 . E_S
96402:22	But , uh , I do not know , E_S
96403:136	\[ I , \+ you \] see it \[ \[ in , \+ uh , also in , \] \+ uh , like in \] church , uh , where more and more women are becoming ministers . \[ In , \+ uh , you know , in \] protestant congregations *T*-1 E_S

96428:5	probably not . E_S
96432:55	So , uh , uh , \[ how about , \+ what \] in particular would you think \[ that , uh , women still , \+ other than the work place , where women still \] are being , uh , oh , you know , MUMBLEx found *-1 wanting , you know , or not \[ re- , \+ as highly *ICH*-2 regarded *-1 \] as men would be *?* *-4 *T*-3 .

96434:24	I was just trying *-1 to think . E_S

96440:23	\[ \[ what do you think that , \+ what do you think *T*-1 , \] \+ * tell me what you think *T*-2 \] about this . E_S

96453:54	And the only , uh , branch in the armed \[ fo- , \+ services \] that *T*-1 seems willing *-2 to do that is the Air Force . E_S

96480:49	But , that does not sit very well with a lot of folks , I am sure 0 *T*-1 . E_S
96486:10	You know , \[ Neil , \+ well Neil \] as far as I am concerned *-1 , and MUMBLEx I could be wrong about this , \[ but \+ \] the only one area where a woman could not do it *T*-2 is if she just physically did not have the strength , * to do something . E_S

96541:56	She 's a lot more forthright about her opinions and , a little more assertive , than I think 0 I was *?* . E_S

96837:14	But do n't you think 0 it 's that way with men too ? E_S
96838:20	I mean , you know , men are sitting behind desks a whole lot more , than they used *-1 to . E_S
96852:14	And , you know , medical reports tell us that women are developing diseases *ICH*-3 now that *T*-1 used *-2 to be predominately male diseases . E_S

96975:27	Well , I just am very much a believer in quiet personal time . E_S

96989:15	There 's nothing wrong with * sitting and being bored , if you thinking internally , and you are , working on your own self . E_S

97084:10	You know , you work it out for yourself . E_S

97108:77	we are talking about mediators who *T*-1 get involved *-2 in family crises , parents and children , husbands and wives , uh , you know , boss and employee . Those kinds of things . Interpersonal mediation , E_S
97153:16	I do not really know , E_S
97180:29	Uh , \[ and , \+ and \] I might , N_S
97196:17	But , uh , I might start *-1 to go crazy with it too . E_S
97208:8	I think 0 it does \[ when , \+ when \] they are real little *T*-1 E_S
97220:18	Well , \[ I think 0 for me , MUMBLEx the important concerns , \+ I do not think \] 0 I would put her in day care for joint , situation right now , unless it was like one other child \[ with a , \+ with a \] person . E_S
97220:56	Well , \[ I think 0 for me , MUMBLEx the important concerns , \+ I do not think \] 0 I would put her in day care for joint , situation right now , unless it was like one other child \[ with a , \+ with a \] person . E_S
97227:76	I would not want her to be \[ into a , \+ in a \] large day care situation *-2 so young . Because I think 0 a little infant just does not get the stimulation 0 they need *T*-1 . E_S
97234:55	Maybe if I needed *-1 to work part time , like four hours a day , I might do that , cause like , you should get enough stimulation from you the rest of the time . E_S
97235:20	But , uh , I just think that , you know , when there 's two year olds running around *T*-1 , \[ the , \+ \[ whoever *T*-2 is taking care of , \+ the care givers \] \] are going *-3 to pay attention to the two year olds . E_S
97235:33	But , uh , I just think that , you know , when there 's two year olds running around *T*-1 , \[ the , \+ \[ whoever *T*-2 is taking care of , \+ the care givers \] \] are going *-3 to pay attention to the two year olds . E_S
97243:54	and if not , the infant is going *-1 to lay in the crib all day , and maybe have a mobile *ICH*-2 above it 0 * to play with *T*-3 . E_S
97247:14	And , you know , I play with her most of the time 0 she is awake *T*-1 E_S
97248:10	and I think 0 that is so important . E_S
97256:46	Well , such as things for learning gives the child stimulation 0 I think 0 *T*-1 is important . E_S
97268:29	\[ and , \+ uh , and \] a certain type of stimulations N_S
97269:89	and there 's times of day that even when the child is awake *T*-1 \[ that they , \+ that they \] lay quietly and look at certain things E_S
97277:32	and \[ they will have on- , \+ I think 0 one \] of them was a little mirror E_S
97278:68	and some were just different objects that *T*-1 \[ have , \+ had \] a definite purpose for kids , you know , E_S
97288:73	well \[ she 's , \+ she 's \] just been doing all kinds of stuff where she 's , you know MUMBLEx , N_S
97309:15	And \[ I think that , \+ you know , I think \] 0 child care for infants is much harder than when they are older *T*-1 , E_S
97309:31	And \[ I think that , \+ you know , I think \] 0 child care for infants is much harder than when they are older *T*-1 , E_S
97309:39	And \[ I think that , \+ you know , I think \] 0 child care for infants is much harder than when they are older *T*-1 , E_S
97310:13	and I will probably be going back to work around January , whereas she will be about , eight or nine months old . E_S
97317:13	And so I think , you know , 0 she will be at a , N_S
97317:23	And so I think , you know , 0 she will be at a , N_S
97324:10	so you might have a real problem with that . E_S
97325:8	I think 0 \[ it , \+ it *EXP*-1 \] hurts the parents * to leave when the child is crying *T*-2 , E_S
97327:24	\[ But , \+ but \] I think 0 it , N_S
97329:24	so \[ it , \+ you know , it \] would be ideal if you could get somebody in so you are not really leaving the child in a strange place . E_S
97336:36	Uh , but I am trying *-1 to , you know , leave her a fair amount , even at this young age , with her grandparents , just to , go to a movie and things like that . So that she is used to other people taking care of her . E_S
97346:17	but during , you know , N_S
97360:85	\[ it would , \+ if they were where I could not get my hands on them *T*-1 , I am afraid 0 I would \] probably go crazy . E_S
97364:10	You know , \[ I , \+ I \] like that , E_S
97376:28	Well , if I work part time that might be doable . E_S
97395:12	but you know , since this is , N_S
97401:14	And , you know , I just find that incredible . E_S
97407:14	And , you know , * maybe do some free lance type work at home . E_S
97407:22	And , you know , * maybe do some free lance type work at home . E_S
97426:20	And so , uh , she might be able *-1 to do it a couple of hours a day E_S
97427:22	and we \[ cou- , \+ might \] even be able *-1 to do it on a trade off basis . That I watch , their baby when they want *-2 to go out to dinner or to movies or whatever *T*-4 , or if she wants an afternoon off . Even if she wants an afternoon 0 * just to work . Uh , and not be bothered *T*-5 , E_S
97441:8	we might be able *-1 to exchange that way . E_S
97446:15	But \[ I think 0 the whole , \+ you know , ideally I think , \] uh , 0 business should have the , day care centers there , whether it 's the parents who *T*-1 take turns *-2 watching the kids , or whether E_S

98326:11	it would certainly be an interesting test E_S

98432:37	if you 're going *-1 to drink , and you may drink , you better have your designated driver . E_S
98436:61	In this country , and for example with alcohol or with drugs \[ is , \+ \] we do n't seem *-1 to understand how * to handle it as a society to say \[ okay , \+ it is okay \] under these circumstances , but if you step outside these bounds , the punishment is extreme *T*-2 .
98443:20	\[ That , \+ I think that , \] uh , the drunk driving has \[ just \+ actually , just \] caught on . E_S

98719:43	Well , of course , you 've been at Clark enough that you know 0 it 's always cold . E_S
98723:17	But , you do n't know , uh , I guess at some of the other schools 0 you go to *T*-1 unless you 've been there . E_S
98735:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 some of the dress codes are different at different schools . E_S
98736:70	That 's \[ one of things , \+ one of the things \] 0 I ask about *T*-1 , you know , \[ whether , \+ whether \] she would allow slacks E_S
98742:40	\[ And , \+ and \] I said , well , you know , that was okay . E_S
98744:31	basically , \[ I just , \+ you know , I wear \] slacks year round except \[ every , \+ \] about once a week I try *-1 to wear a skirt . E_S
98745:36	\[ And , \+ and \] in the winter , you know , I \[ just add a , \+ \] maybe wear longer sleeve shirts than I do in the summer . And add a heavier jacket or , you know , wear jackets more *ICH*-1 in the winter than I do in the summer . E_S

98754:17	or they , you know , \[ have , \+ have \] spirit week \[ that , \+ that \] you wear your different outfits *T*-1 E_S
98762:10	And one might be a hat day where you have *-1 to come up with some sort of hat *T*-2 . E_S
98764:14	And you never know that , though sometimes when you 're going in *T*-1 , do you ? E_S
98769:57	but because I sort of stick to several schools , uh , I 'm usually aware that there might be a spirit week going on \[ and , \+ and \] might , might remember *-1 to do it . E_S

98774:53	And then many schools on a particular day during , uh , I guess football season , maybe all year long , they wear the school colors for , uh , game day which , N_S
98783:8	it might be Thursday for the high schools E_S
98784:10	and it may be Friday for the senior high schools . E_S
98796:15	and I do n't know , you know , E_S
98796:25	and I do n't know , you know , E_S
98797:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think about , well , the dress code 0 they have *T*-1 for the kids , you know . E_S
98797:73	\[ I , \+ I \] think about , well , the dress code 0 they have *T*-1 for the kids , you know . E_S
98802:29	because some of the teachers 0 I know *T*-1 wear , uh , dress up jeans , not sloppy looking jeans but tapered jeans that they 've had *T*-2 dry cleaned *-3 so they have got the crease E_S
98806:19	and , uh , you know , they 'll wear it with a nice top . E_S
98807:36	\[ And , \+ and , \] uh , I do n't know that that looks that bad . E_S

98817:22	But \[ it , \+ I think 0 it \] varies , \[ \[ it , \+ it \] \+ \] just so much . E_S
98832:35	And they 'll just wear your common , ordinary , you know , whatever you \[ might \+ might \] say *T*-2 , E_S

98848:30	course , it 's a standing joke , you know , \[ when the , \+ when the \] men come \[ in \+ in \] \[ a , \+ a \] tie and a suit coat *T*-1 , you say , you know , what , have you got a job interview today E_S

98890:22	That 's what I would think *T*-1 . E_S
98892:50	But , \[ \[ they , \+ they \] do n't look , \+ you know , they do n't wear \] their sweat pants \[ or , \+ or \] anything . E_S

98922:31	I \[ r- , \+ do n't really \] know if they still do . E_S
98927:8	It certainly makes it *EXP*-1 easier * to dress . E_S
98929:82	but even there 's a couple public schools in Dallas \[ where , \+ where \] the kids wear uniforms *T*-1 and the teachers , you know , dress in accordance with that *T*-1 . E_S
98934:20	Well , it *EXP*-2 's certainly cheaper and easier in the long run , I think , that you do n't have *-1 to be concerned about your wardrobe . E_S

98937:26	Well \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 it would make a difference at school . E_S
98938:28	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't think 0 we should be spending time *-1 saying 0 somebody 's wearing torn clothing or wearing \[ sh- , \+ \[ too \+ \] shorts , \] too short E_S
98939:50	or they 've got the really short skirt and the black nylons and the high , you know , N_S
98947:111	I 'd like *-1 to see them go \[ to , \+ to \] not necessarily a uniform , but * saying that they 've got *-2 to wear a button down shirt . You know , E_S
98971:8	They may get a- , N_S
98977:13	Well , I think 0 it does . E_S
98980:13	Highland Park 's thinking about *-1 going that route . E_S

98988:28	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't think 0 a lot of teachers are very professional E_S
99013:27	and , uh , also U of M seemed overwhelming in size E_S
99060:47	\[ Is , \+ uh , because you live in Austin , is \] she thinking about the University of Texas ? E_S

99080:51	The reason 0 I ask if you went to college *T*-1 is 0 I thought , well , you know , N_S

99087:22	Uh , my parents , uh , certainly did n't push but wanted me to look in the south E_S
99088:52	and because I had been in a small school , they suggested that \[ I \+ probably , I , \] N_S
99093:23	And so they suggested that I might want a smaller school because I was used to a lot of one-on-one uh , or small group situations . E_S
99106:13	and we just thought 0 that would be a wonderful thing E_S
99124:25	\[ He , \+ but he \] thinks 0 he wants *-1 to be a writer E_S

99157:68	That was the one and only thing 0 I could really afford *T*-1 other than \[ a jun- , \+ you know , a junior \] college , which I did n't want *-2 to do *T*-3 . E_S
99158:24	So that 's how , you know , my decision was made *-1 *T*-2 . E_S
99161:31	Well , \[ th- , \+ that 's \] certainly , N_S

99197:17	And , I do n't know , E_S
99199:10	and she may end up *-1 doing something with that . E_S
99202:16	and I made the mistake of *-1 dropping out of college *-2 to get married . E_S
99203:41	So I 'm trying *-1 to have my children not make the same mistake . E_S
99204:20	And I 'm , you know , showing them 0 if you 're strong in math and science , kiddos , this is one area where women can make some decent money *T*-1 . You know . E_S

99224:10	You know , \[ it 's , \+ the , it 's , \] N_S
99226:30	Well , the weather \[ has been , \+ certainly has been \] hot E_S

99253:8	it seemed like ,
99254:15	well , you know , last year was so strange * having all those heavy , heavy rains in April E_S
99260:35	and it was trying *-1 to rain which *T*-2 seems strange * to have it raining in July . E_S
99287:40	\[ and not , \+ and \] \[ al- , \+ you know , every \] day was cloudy , E_S
99300:14	and , you know , so many times when you were trying *-1 to schedule outdoor activities *T*-2 , you just never knew if it was going *-3 to be a go or not because of the weather . E_S
99301:8	It might rain on your little parade . E_S
99306:10	You know , and here it was like , pretty much you could schedule some activity outside anytime E_S
99325:8	You probably know where that is *T*-1 because I know where Pontiac is *T*-2 , E_S
99325:11	You probably know where that is *T*-1 because I know where Pontiac is *T*-2 , E_S
99325:35	You probably know where that is *T*-1 because I know where Pontiac is *T*-2 , E_S
99356:46	so I MUMBLEx school and said hey , * let 's , you know , find a place that *T*-1 has a nice job E_S
99360:8	I think 0 a lot of people were , uh , leaving Michigan all about the time 0 I came here in the early eighties *T*-1 E_S
99361:10	and it seemed like it was almost a mass exodus . E_S
99365:8	You know , \[ the , \+ the \] little joke about , will the last person leaving Michigan just turn out the light . E_S
99367:35	Oh , well , it 's a nice place , you know , E_S
99370:15	Well , you know , \[ I , \+ I \] said 0 I lived in , uh , the Pontiac . E_S
99374:12	but you know where all the lakes are *T*-1 around there . E_S
99383:10	You know , in the summer , you feel like you 're , you know , on a vacation all the time because you 're right on a lake E_S
99383:48	You know , in the summer , you feel like you 're , you know , on a vacation all the time because you 're right on a lake E_S
99384:20	and everybody 's , you know , out enjoying the water and such , E_S
99387:10	but I thought 0 it *EXP*-1 was just really neat * to be out there on all those lakes . E_S
99392:10	You know , like maybe a mile , two long . E_S
99392:20	You know , like maybe a mile , two long . E_S
99403:20	\[ Lake , \+ I think 0 Lake \] Whitmore is the only one 0 I have real memories of *T*-1 . Which *T*-2 is , N_S
99407:18	well , \[ I think 0 it 's , \+ I think 0 it 's \] toward Ann Arbor , E_S
99407:39	well , \[ I think 0 it 's , \+ I think 0 it 's \] toward Ann Arbor , E_S
99408:13	so it 's probably out in that direction , E_S
99409:29	but that 's the only one 0 I probably could name *T*-1 after all these years E_S
99420:34	and , of course , it *EXP*-1 was , you know , a little more expensive * to live on the lake , E_S
99421:13	but I just thought 0 that was grand . E_S
99422:10	And I think 0 a lot of people did n't really know that there were all those lakes out there unless you were from that area and kind of spotted them , E_S
99422:37	And I think 0 a lot of people did n't really know that there were all those lakes out there unless you were from that area and kind of spotted them , E_S
99424:13	\[ It seemed like , \+ it was almost like \] you were living on an island E_S
99427:27	I was way out to the west maybe four or five miles \[ from , \+ from \] the city limits E_S

99446:4	sure , E_S
99456:8	I know , 0 we used *-1 to , N_S
99475:58	my dad would kind of bank up the snow in the backyard and turn the hose on , you know , make a pond in the backyard for us . E_S
99480:31	\[ So \+ but , \] uh , you know , we probably did some ice skating on it , E_S
99480:39	\[ So \+ but , \] uh , you know , we probably did some ice skating on it , E_S
99482:14	and , you know , it would melt or whatever and get pretty uneven E_S
99489:10	and I think 0 most times we would have snow around Christmas E_S
99494:10	You know , because they were from Alabama where it never snowed *T*-1 E_S
99498:65	and they just had a grand time *-1 watching the snow and getting out there and playing in it , you know , eternally . E_S
99518:91	And I remember *-1 getting up and somebody telling me , hey , better * wait * to go to work because the roads are all , you know , snow . E_S
99533:8	I know . E_S
99553:8	I think 0 we must be the only people on the block that *T*-1 make use of that cold weather and get out there . E_S
99556:8	I think 0 it 's fun , E_S
99559:77	but if you get on the , the , uh , grassy kind of part , you get a little bit of traction , you know , not slip and fall . E_S
99632:64	My daughter was going , to Camp Goddard , um , which *T*-1 is through the Plano school system , you know in the fall couple of years ago E_S
99662:17	And so , you know , we do n't get paid *-1 for that E_S
99667:10	You know , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] not that much of a bother really . E_S
99680:58	because when the kids first went down *T*-1 , I said , \[ that , \+ you know that 's \] great E_S

99715:10	You know , \[ no , \+ no \] more often then that . E_S

99770:20	\[ Proba- , \+ we probably \] will *?* . E_S
99773:49	We keep a large plastic , uh , \[ \[ just a , \+ you know , a \] \+ \] garbage bag in the garage . E_S

99790:10	You know , MUMBLEx , um , I read \[ \[ a book one time \+ or a m- , \] \+ a magazine \] article E_S

99912:93	Well the kids have even got to the point where \[ they , \+ if they \] see anybody going in the trash can with a can , you know , \[ they , \+ they 're , \] oh , no , * do n't do that *T*-1 E_S
99955:9	and , probably the first question would be whether you 've ever had *-1 to go through that process . E_S

100007:30	so I think 0 she was , you know ,
100012:13	So often I think though , 0 *T*-1 elderly people do n't realize that their diet is that bad . E_S
100018:15	and so often they think 0 they 're adequately caring for themselves when they 're really not eating \[ very much \+ or very balanced \] meals *T*-1 . E_S
100025:13	Well you know that 's part of the aging process , That your taste buds goes back to the sweet taste . E_S
100054:74	Although they 've got , uh , Meals On Wheels , Which I understand 0 *T*-1 is a really good , you know , way 0 * to handle that so that at least they eat *T*-2 . E_S
100061:7	or probably in College Station there was n't a whole lot of choice . E_S
100064:13	I do n't think 0 there was *?* . Um , E_S
100065:8	I know a little bit more from \[ a , \+ a \] co-worker . E_S
100074:23	so they were almost , you know , to the point of *-1 saying she ca n't be here anymore . E_S
100078:67	But , I remember 0 from her checking around , she ended up *-1 staying at the Arkansas House I think 0 *T*-2 out in Arlington , something like that . E_S
100082:17	And , uh , you know the type of facilities whether it 's a shared room or two separate rooms that *T*-1 share uh , a , uh , bathroom .
100083:17	All of them all seem *-2 to say that people there are going *-3 to steal their items . E_S
100089:24	and some of them , I think 0 *T*-1 unconsciously do it , you know , as a just , you know , half seni- , N_S
100089:49	and some of them , I think 0 *T*-1 unconsciously do it , you know , as a just , you know , half seni- , N_S
100089:70	and some of them , I think 0 *T*-1 unconsciously do it , you know , as a just , you know , half seni- , N_S
100094:46	And sometimes \[ the , \+ the \] help there does it , I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
100096:61	Uh . So , \[ they , \+ they , \] uh , do n't have too many facilities it seems 0 *T*-1 for their personal items .
100101:26	but , um , at least they all seem *-1 to have , uh , you know , people that *T*-2 monitor their , uh , medication intake and dining facilities ,
100101:51	but , um , at least they all seem *-1 to have , uh , you know , people that *T*-2 monitor their , uh , medication intake and dining facilities ,
100102:10	you know , * go to the dining room \[ and , \+ and \] eat some good meals . E_S
100106:8	I know 0 when my friend 's mother-in-law first went in *T*-1 ,
100119:24	\[ I , \+ as I think 0 I \] mentioned , I was in the trust business E_S
100122:110	but \[ the , \+ the \] places like Presbyterian Village and some of \[ the , \+ the \] retirement places \[ where , \+ where \] they have different levels of care *T*-1 seems *-2 to be so much better , as far as elderly people adapting . E_S
100146:8	it seems like the women \[ out \+ just out \] live their husbands , but , very reluctantly , E_S
100160:10	You know once you make that step you know that it 's just going *-1 to be downhill from then on E_S
100160:31	You know once you make that step you know that it 's just going *-1 to be downhill from then on E_S
100166:19	in fact , that 's probably what *T*-1 's going *-2 to happen with my husband 's mother . E_S
100167:43	She 's going *-1 to endanger herself before she 'll willingly and probably will never willingly make the decision . E_S
100168:34	And that scares me \[ the , \+ the \] thought of * forcing somebody to do something . E_S
100171:10	you know they ca n't get out and see anyone E_S
100176:27	because \[ I th- , \+ I think , \] what do you have *T*-1 there ? E_S
100187:54	Do n't you want *-1 to be close to me ? . I mean , you know be with other people . E_S
100222:8	I know 0 they 're really proud of independence . E_S
100246:10	You know , it 's just , N_S
100252:36	and we ca n't see her often enough *-1 to really know what *T*-2 's going on . E_S
100262:29	my , husband and I , we have been thinking about
100271:10	So we thought 0 maybe we could get them to move a little closer here . E_S
100271:17	So we thought 0 maybe we could get them to move a little closer here . E_S
100286:31	Because \[ I , \+ I \] did n't know if that would make a difference in how you felt *T*-1 . E_S
100290:19	Um , what do you think *T*-1 about the proposal that all young Americans should spend a year or two , N_S
100292:8	I think 0 it 's a good idea . E_S
100293:8	I think 0 everybody \[ should , \+ should , \] uh , put in their time so * to speak \[ for the , \+ for the \] good of \[ the , \+ the \] nation and for the good of themselves . E_S
100297:8	I think 0 it 's , uh , N_S
100301:68	I guess 0 \[ that 's MUMBLEx , my , \+ that 's something that my \] family has always believed strongly in *T*-1 , E_S
100309:109	\[ and , \+ and \] I agree with what you said *T*-1 that \[ it 's , \+ uh , it \] benefits the person doing it so much 0 I do n't think 0 they realize E_S
100315:45	and \[ \[ I , \+ uh , I , \] \+ I \] think 0 it gives you a better perspective , on life E_S
100319:25	\[ and \+ and \] it would certainly help the country , too , uh . E_S
100326:8	I think 0 that 's probably like , uh , quite a few things \[ that , \+ that \] the kids , uh , maybe not so much nowadays but used *-1 to go through *T*-2 , you know , E_S

100336:13	Well , I think 0 sometimes through groups and organizations , um , N_S
100337:38	\[ \[ \[ my first , \+ when I first thought of it *T*-1 , \] \+ I thought 0 it , \] \+ uh , when they asked the question *T*-2 I thought , \] well that sounds wonderful . E_S

100348:11	that 's probably true . You know E_S
100348:24	that 's probably true . You know E_S

100363:8	I think 0 that 's probably true . E_S

100367:8	I think 0 it 's probably more true *ICH*-1 *ICH*-2 , still \[ in the , \+ in the \] smaller communities then in the larger cities . E_S

100402:17	And , uh , I think 0 it was just MUMBLEx , N_S

100405:26	\[ I \+ MUMBLEx , I \] think 0 people thought more *ICH*-1 of others than they do now . You know , as far as *-2 doing things for them \[ and , \+ and \] then gaining benefits from it . E_S

100414:50	\[ if , \+ if \] young people had *-1 to do it um , maybe that would start the trend back because that 's one of the things 0 I always thought 0 *T*-2 was a wonderful part of our country . Um , is * helping others . E_S

100448:23	that 's something that I think that *T*-1 has been lost *-2 in families E_S
100449:10	and I think 0 that 's a good place 0 * to start again *T*-1 . E_S
100452:8	I think 0 it has *-1 to start in the families first because if you do n't do it \[ for , \+ for \] your own immediate family , you 're sure not going *-2 to do it for anybody else . E_S

100455:13	And I do think , um , 0 the schools , N_S
100463:14	gosh I 'm sure , 0 not even one percent of the world is as fortunate as these areas E_S
100466:11	That 's probably true . E_S
100467:11	That 's probably true . E_S
100469:8	I know 0 our church youth group , uh , starts with projects * young E_S
100493:49	So , if two weeks , uh , could have that kind of effect I would think , uh , N_S
100502:20	Like I said , I think 0 it does , E_S
100503:34	\[ e- , \+ even \] a small amount of exposure can make a vast difference in their attitudes . E_S
100548:87	Uh , when I was in Minnesota last summer *T*-1 there was a teacher who *T*-2 said that , uh , on a given day she did n't know how many of her students *T*-3 would show up E_S
100570:39	because \[ it , \+ it \] said that , you know , N_S
100572:59	but for those students who *T*-1 are determined *-2 to do well anyway , that , you know , * handling a job was very possible . You know , and that it seemed *-3 to have more 0 * to do *T*-4 with other factors . E_S

100576:8	I think so too . E_S
100578:10	You know like , what are their plans after high school *T*-1 , you know . E_S
100578:48	You know like , what are their plans after high school *T*-1 , you know . E_S
100580:8	You know that , N_S
100586:8	I think really is *?* because if the home , does not place a high priority on education N_S
100593:10	and it may be a survival thing for the family , which you can understand *T*-1 . E_S
100606:10	you know , this is a stopgap measure because we need it right now , E_S
100606:25	you know , this is a stopgap measure because we need it right now , E_S
100607:57	\[ but , \+ but \] \[ that \+ the \] most important thing is still , you know * getting your education . E_S
100613:62	Well when they \[ meant , \+ said \] \[ the , \+ the \] topic , you know , of what *T*-1 's wrong with the public schools *T*-2 , \[ my , \+ my \] first \[ im- , \+ impulse \] was 0 it is n't really what *T*-3 's wrong with the \[ public , \+ public \] schools . E_S
100613:81	Well when they \[ meant , \+ said \] \[ the , \+ the \] topic , you know , of what *T*-1 's wrong with the public schools *T*-2 , \[ my , \+ my \] first \[ im- , \+ impulse \] was 0 it is n't really what *T*-3 's wrong with the \[ public , \+ public \] schools . E_S

100614:22	It 's what *T*-1 's wrong with families . E_S
100619:22	It 's what *T*-1 's wrong with families E_S
100627:13	they do n't know what * to expect *T*-1 at home . E_S
100629:13	they do n't know what *T*-1 's going *-2 to happen just out front of their apartment complex . E_S
100642:8	I think 0 that 's the main problem . E_S
100655:37	Well \[ we 've got , \+ uh , you know at our school we have \] over a thousand elementary kids E_S
100663:82	and they said , oh , \[ but \+ \] we need more in the middle school because that 's when kids are , you know , at a tougher and rougher age and all that *T*-1 . E_S
100664:14	But , you know , part of my feeling is that if you \[ solve , \+ help \] them to work through their problems while they 're littler , then they wo n't have as many problems up there . E_S
100667:8	I think 0 \[ they , \+ there \] has *-1 to be at least a counselor E_S
100680:80	So they started , uh , *-1 dividing the kids up so that a counselor stays with her group of counselees \[ through \+ you know , through \] all three years of middle school . E_S
100690:10	And I think 0 that would give them more security in * going to the counselor . E_S
100710:8	it certainly is *?* . E_S
100733:36	And , uh , one of the , uh , you know , oh , N_S
100735:51	But , anyway , one of the key things was \[ that \+ that \] we believed that the public education is the best economic value . E_S
100736:11	Then I think 0 they decided *-1 to strike economic . E_S
100740:15	Anyway , you know , the point was , what *T*-1 happens when public education fails *T*-2 ? E_S
100741:10	You know will then people go to private schools ? E_S
100745:10	You know , well , what kind of a situation do they get *T*-1 there E_S
100746:20	and what are , you know , N_S
100749:11	Well I think , uh , 0 one thing that we 'll see *T*-1 is that we wo n't be educating everybody . E_S
100771:61	And * let everyone have an opportunity * to reach higher education if they 're willing , you know , *-1 to work and have , uh , some ability . E_S
100780:33	and one of the Plano school district 's , you know , goals is that they will graduate every child \[ that , \+ uh , that \] *T*-1 is here in the ninth grade , E_S
100781:8	I believe 0 it 's something like that , E_S
100786:22	And , uh , I do n't know . E_S
100788:13	Well you know if we can keep them in school . N_S
100799:8	I think 0 the gang violence is scaring everyone to death too . E_S
100817:41	and they 're talking a lot about \[ the , \+ you know , the \] school situation there , too . E_S
100822:8	I think 0 we have *?* to . E_S
100904:36	And , uh , we 've just been real lucky I think 0 *T*-2 , anyway . *-1 To not , N_S
100922:25	but they \[ were so , \+ seemed , \] cold and impersonal , E_S
100957:30	that is , uh , a big drawback I think 0 *T*-1 \[ in that , \+ in the , \] uh , public schools out here . You know , to , E_S
100957:88	that is , uh , a big drawback I think 0 *T*-1 \[ in that , \+ in the , \] uh , public schools out here . You know , to , E_S
100962:47	and if you do you get them once a week or something , you know . E_S
100967:12	and you know , I willingly did it E_S
100972:10	but I thought , this makes me angry . E_S
100980:25	And with our budget cuts , I 'm sure 0 that 's \[ not going * to \+ not going *-1 to \] change anytime soon . E_S
100990:22	So , in some ways I think 0 *T*-1 \[ the , \+ the \] day schools do serve those purposes . E_S
100994:24	Well even the preschools , you know they get so much of that in preschool E_S
100995:34	and then when they hit kindergarten *T*-1 , you know , it 's like wham . Culture shock . E_S
101010:14	and , you know . N_S
101032:10	but I know so many people that *T*-1 are never able *-2 to find that E_S
101087:19	oh I ca n't even think of the name of it . E_S
101097:63	and \[ the , \+ the \] doctor that *T*-1 was on there , the pediatrician said , you know , I ca n't imagine *-2 leaving a three week old and taking them to a nursery day-care and leaving them there . E_S
101104:10	You know , so , um , N_S
101122:20	or they 've , you know , whatever schedule they want *T*-1 from a pay standpoint . E_S
101143:10	but I think 0 we 're finally beginning *-1 to make progress but just not very fast . E_S
101157:28	But \[ I , \+ I \] do think 0 it 's an area that *T*-1 needs *-2 to be looked at *-3 and improved *-3 because more of us are going *-4 to have *-5 to work . E_S
101162:18	Two income families I think 0 *T*-1 are here *-2 to stay . E_S
101164:16	Well and I would think , you know , 0 since big business is supposedly why the government makes the decisions 0 they do *T*-1 *T*-2 you know , \[ the , \+ the \] people that *T*-3 work in big business have families E_S
101164:26	Well and I would think , you know , 0 since big business is supposedly why the government makes the decisions 0 they do *T*-1 *T*-2 you know , \[ the , \+ the \] people that *T*-3 work in big business have families E_S

101177:8	Oh sure . E_S
101197:8	It seems *-1 to help the new mothers not have *-2 to come back full-time . E_S
101203:25	That 's good 0 * to know *T*-1 . E_S
101204:81	I have a couple of friends that , *T*-1 \[ have , \+ have \] found \[ \[ the , \+ uh , you know , a pri- , \] \+ a private \] home 0 * to take their children to *T*-2 when they 're young *T*-3 until they hit the preschool age . E_S

101366:20	Um , and , MUMBLEx I think that no matter what I do *T*-1 , I do n't serve enough *ICH*-2 of it , really , * \[ to , \+ uh , to \] suit him . E_S

101441:13	I do n't know , E_S
101456:13	I do n't know , E_S
101457:37	\[ I , \+ it 's , \] I do n't know what , E_S
101458:13	I do n't know . E_S
101459:28	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't know what *ICH*-2 it is *T*-1 about the enchiladas . E_S
101473:10	But I think 0 it 's good \[ \[ for , \+ you know , for , \] \+ for \] company , too , E_S
101473:47	But I think 0 it 's good \[ \[ for , \+ you know , for , \] \+ for \] company , too , E_S
101475:107	Um , and you can make a lot at one time when I needed *-1 to make something 0 * \[ to , \+ uh , to \] give somebody *T*-2 . You know , like , you know , to take *T*-2 over to somebody 's house or something else *T*-3 . E_S

101501:49	\[ So , \+ or \] I give it to my Mom and Dad if I know 0 we 're not going *-1 to eat , N_S
101537:56	\[ it , \+ it 's , \] as much as you want *?* , you know torn * up \[ and , \+ and \] rice and cream of chicken soup and some mayonnaise and lemon juice and celery E_S
101537:105	\[ it , \+ it 's , \] as much as you want *?* , you know torn * up \[ and , \+ and \] rice and cream of chicken soup and some mayonnaise and lemon juice and celery E_S
101554:58	You just mix it all together and pop it in the oven *-1 just to , you know , heat it through . E_S
101566:23	And that 's it , you know . E_S
101588:18	I bet 0 the mayonnaise in there \[ makes it really , \+ kind of gives it \] a tang that *T*-1 would be good . E_S
101595:46	I guess 0 I would now use \[ the , \+ the \] new mayonnaise free . E_S
101601:104	That 's really wonderful that they 're coming out with so many new things like that because like I told my husband this summer , 0 I love *-1 to eat , you know , chicken salad and tuna salad and stuff like that E_S
101608:28	\[ and , \+ and , \] you know , basically it certainly a \[ l- , \+ low \] calorie , you know , good thing except then you put your mayonnaise in there and spoil the whole thing . E_S

101612:10	You know and now \[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's , \] \+ it 's \] okay E_S
101617:41	I do n't like tuna salad unless it 's got lots of mayonnaise in it . E_S
101627:8	I know . E_S
101629:11	I just think 0 that 's the best thing 0 *T*-1 to have happened , E_S
101647:36	So , when we 're here at home , you know , with sweets and stuff *T*-1 , \[ \[ they , \+ they do n't , \] \+ we do n't \] really do that much . E_S
101648:48	I do a lot of fruits instead of the cakes and the candies and you know , stuff like that . E_S
101691:24	\[ It 's , \+ I think 0 it 's \] mostly hereditary because we really have never eaten high things in cholesterol . E_S
101697:12	and you know , I 've never bought butter and things like that . E_S
101707:38	So we 've really been talking about the foods , you know , 0 for him \[ to , \+ to \] be sure *-2 to eat *T*-1 E_S
101707:74	So we 've really been talking about the foods , you know , 0 for him \[ to , \+ to \] be sure *-2 to eat *T*-1 E_S
101715:13	Well , I think 0 we 've probably talked long enough E_S
101715:26	Well , I think 0 we 've probably talked long enough E_S
101739:8	I think 0 all mine have been East Coast people so far . E_S
101771:4	sure . E_S
101782:13	uh , it seems to me that , uh , N_S
101784:31	That involves a lot of different areas , I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
101793:8	it seems like the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer , is even more , true today . You know ? E_S
101793:73	it seems like the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer , is even more , true today . You know ? E_S
101798:77	there is \[ a \+ a \] big difference in the , uh , economic , um , status of , uh , people although I think 0 that has been true , uh , always . E_S
101815:8	I think , uh , 0 \[ m- , \+ in my \] situation , N_S
101818:26	So , \[ education , \+ you know , things that *T*-1 relate \[ t- , \+ to \] education , \] um , are things that I think about *T*-2 a lot . E_S
101818:92	So , \[ education , \+ you know , things that *T*-1 relate \[ t- , \+ to \] education , \] um , are things that I think about *T*-2 a lot . E_S
101819:18	Um , \[ I think 0 that , \+ and I think 0 that \] involves social changes a lot . E_S
101819:38	Um , \[ I think 0 that , \+ and I think 0 that \] involves social changes a lot . E_S
101820:21	Uh , for instance , I think 0 the schools are having more and more problems because of , uh , things that *T*-1 are happening socially in the world around them and \[ \[ in , \+ in , \] t- , \+ \] because of their parents E_S and things that *T*-1 are being taught *-2 in the home are not taught *-2 in the home , rather . More not than * are *?* . And children being put *-3 in day-care centers from very early , N_S
101821:24	\[ and , \+ and \] I think that a lot of these things that *T*-1 have been happening , such as the day-care centers and things , are having a big effect on the social changes . E_S
101828:17	And , uh , I think 0 we 're seeing a lot of rebellion and things because of that and the things like the \[ gang , \+ gang \] things that *T*-1 are happening E_S
101832:8	It seems , so that , N_S
101835:8	It seems , even not just single parent families but with no guidance N_S
101836:10	but it seems like , some of these even ladies \[ that , \+ that *T*-1 'll \] work and have , a baby and then , you know , after two or three months , go back to work . You know , E_S
101836:89	but it seems like , some of these even ladies \[ that , \+ that *T*-1 'll \] work and have , a baby and then , you know , after two or three months , go back to work . You know , E_S

101851:8	I think that a lot of people , N_S
101852:10	and they think 0 they have *-1 to *?* E_S
101857:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think that if they really tried , they would n't have *-1 to *?* . E_S
101858:27	And , \[ I , \+ I \] think that if they did n't *?* \[ that , \+ \] and it became more of the standard * not to *?* that , uh , I do n't know maybe companies would start *-1 paying men more so that their wives could stay home .

101868:46	like you said , I mean , \[ there 's , \+ they might \] be saving money , E_S
101877:10	You know it , N_S
101878:122	* trying *-1 to do all these programs like Headstart and things like those . You would n't have *-2 to do that if mothers would stay home with their children and do things with them , you know . E_S
101883:10	and I think , uh , 0 a lot of it is selfishness . E_S
101889:101	There are a lot of two parent , um , situations where the woman goes back to work because that 's what she wants *-1 to do *T*-2 *T*-3 , you know . E_S
101898:9	Or , maybe there 's a small need for money E_S
101899:53	so she does it partly because of the money but partly for herself , too . You know , E_S
101934:10	And I think , uh , 0 it 's becoming , uh , more popular then it has been *?* for a while , I think . E_S
101934:78	And I think , uh , 0 it 's becoming , uh , more popular then it has been *?* for a while , I think . E_S
101949:40	That 's pretty sad because , I mean , I do n't know , something 's got *-1 to change with the schools . E_S
101952:13	Well , I think 0 it 's going *-1 to , change in the homes before anything changes anywhere else . E_S
101963:7	and maybe part of that is * educating parents better . E_S
101967:25	And * educating , uh , you know , N_S
101971:8	I know 0 \[ they do do some , \+ they do have some \] classes *ICH*-3 *ICH*-4 in , um , high schools and things for kids 0 *T*-1 to , uh , give them an idea of what family life is like *T*-2 \[ and the , \+ uh , you know , and , uh , that \] kind of thing E_S
101971:165	I know 0 \[ they do do some , \+ they do have some \] classes *ICH*-3 *ICH*-4 in , um , high schools and things for kids 0 *T*-1 to , uh , give them an idea of what family life is like *T*-2 \[ and the , \+ uh , you know , and , uh , that \] kind of thing E_S
101990:15	Something , you know , N_S
102003:11	Sometimes I think 0 we pay the baby-sitter as much as * paying for their dinner or lunches E_S
102007:35	so , uh , \[ it just , \+ you know , it just \] varies , E_S
102011:21	* just to , you know , have a moment of peace and quiet without little ones at the table . E_S
102041:17	And , uh , we probably go out one to two times a week . E_S
102074:113	So , when we go out *T*-1 , I 'm always looking for something other than the standard menu , even if , it 's a Mexican Restaurant , like something other than , uh , you know the standard tacos , enchiladas , tamales and fajitas now . E_S
102096:13	I do n't think so . E_S
102104:8	I think 0 we 're supposed *-1 to say what *T*-2 will bring us back to a restaurant \[ or , \+ or \] what *T*-3 attracts us to a restaurant . E_S
102109:13	I do n't know . E_S
102110:8	You know what ,
102138:12	And you know , when they say , you know , *-1 buy one * get one free *T*-2 . It 's hard 0 * to resist *T*-3 , E_S
102138:35	And you know , when they say , you know , *-1 buy one * get one free *T*-2 . It 's hard 0 * to resist *T*-3 , E_S
102153:17	But we 've found probably half of our sort of regular restaurants through coupons , and the other half \[ through the , \+ through the \] newspaper reviews . E_S
102172:11	Well I think \[ that it 's just , \+ that 's ex- , \] N_S
102175:11	sometimes I think 0 * going out *-1 to eat \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] sort of a recreation . E_S
102198:49	And , uh , actually it *EXP*-1 's kind of nice * to , you know , N_S
102215:13	\[ it may , \+ it may \] help their tip , may not *?* , huh . E_S
102215:25	\[ it may , \+ it may \] help their tip , may not *?* , huh . E_S
102215:41	\[ it may , \+ it may \] help their tip , may not *?* , huh . E_S
102229:10	You know , we 've never been there . E_S
102260:11	I would probably like that . E_S
102262:14	But , you know , \[ just , \+ it 's just \] not , N_S
102263:13	I do n't know people who *T*-1 hunt E_S
102273:33	And , uh , sometimes we 'll go , you know , E_S
102298:8	I thought , N_S
102337:72	and so since he had this friend up from Houston , uh , and his friend had already seen so many and I thought 0 they decided on this and I thought well , I want *-1 to see this one , too . E_S
102337:97	and so since he had this friend up from Houston , uh , and his friend had already seen so many and I thought 0 they decided on this and I thought well , I want *-1 to see this one , too . E_S
102348:10	and that may be , N_S
102354:13	but I go maybe once every couple of months . E_S
102392:62	And course , * growing up \[ on , \+ on \] the back of a horse , you know , and being on ranches and stuff , so much of that was so true E_S
102403:39	and it is so overacted that you 're just hysterical you know . E_S
102411:39	Well , \[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] know if you got *-1 to see WEEKEND , um , AT BERNIE 'S that *T*-2 was out a couple of years ago . E_S
102419:17	And , I do n't know who *T*-1 was here or whether Jay called a friend E_S
102420:15	and we did n't think 0 we 'd have much chance of * getting in E_S
102421:10	but we thought 0 we 'd try it , you know ,
102421:36	but we thought 0 we 'd try it , you know ,
102437:36	or it should be out on T V , I would think 0 *T*-1 , E_S
102440:8	I think 0 it is *?* . E_S
102441:8	I think 0 it is *?* . E_S
102445:32	Especially in the theater it was contagious , you know E_S
102456:14	and , you know , it was just hysterical . E_S
102460:33	Oh , me too , because I do n't even know if I could live through it now . E_S
102479:41	Oh , so I went up *-1 to do WordPerfect cause that seems like that 's what everybody wants *T*-2 , E_S
102502:19	And , uh , you know , he was teasing me E_S
102511:44	Whatever you call *T*-1 easy , I 'll do it , you know . E_S
102535:107	And , uh , I 'm holding out for CITY SLICKERS for the two of us because , uh , we had friends that *T*-1 went *-2 to see that and said , you know , 0 it 's just perfect for our age group E_S
102539:23	\[ and \+ because \] I think 0 \[ he , \+ he \] needs a comedy , too . E_S
102548:38	and \[ he said , \+ well , realistically , You know , he knew \] 0 he could n't get them all in . E_S
102553:47	Um , when the choir group went *-1 to see BACKDRAFT *T*-2 and they thought 0 \[ that was , \+ uh ,
102555:18	He said , you know 0 the plot line and the characters , uh , you know are n't real big E_S
102555:52	He said , you know 0 the plot line and the characters , uh , you know are n't real big E_S
102556:51	but \[ the , \+ the \] fire scenes and \[ the dra- , \+ you know that action part \] is fantastic . E_S
102560:12	But , he thought 0 ROBIN HOOD was great . E_S
102593:16	Uh , I just thought 0 that was terrific . E_S
102597:8	I think 0 he 's really good . E_S
102600:64	That 's not an easy part 0 * to play *T*-1 , \[ I , \+ I \] do n't think 0 *T*-2 . E_S
102602:13	I would n't think 0 *?* . E_S
102604:15	so I sort of think 0 I may go *-1 do that . E_S
102604:25	so I sort of think 0 I may go *-1 do that . E_S
102616:27	my parents took me when I was probably somewhere between Ashley and Jamie 's age *T*-1 . E_S
102640:44	so , um , mostly like when we go out *T*-1 , you know , it 's my husband and I , E_S
102644:13	I do n't know if you ,
102686:32	Atlantic Cafe is down \[ on , \+ I believe 0 it 's on \] McKinney . E_S
102695:8	I think 0 they 're wonderful . E_S
102697:10	You know what we 'd really like *T*-1 , \[ if , \+ if \] we just have \[ a , \+ a \] casual evening is Houston 's . E_S
102710:27	So you have *-1 to go *-2 knowing 0 you 're going *-3 to be sitting there there for an hour * waiting *-4 to get in . E_S
102711:37	And , \[ a- , \+ as \] long as you know that , it 's okay . E_S
102712:20	But they have , I think , \[ one , \+ \] just about the best prime rib um , anywhere in the area . E_S
102730:8	You know right away what you want *T*-1 . E_S
102732:8	I know right away \[ what we , \+ what we \] want *T*-1 . E_S
102751:71	\[ \[ I 've nev- , \+ I 've , \] \+ I 've \] been there for like , you know , lunch E_S
102776:15	And I did n't think 0 we ate out very often . E_S
102844:41	\[ and , \+ and \] they keep *-1 saying , you know , oh , it 's wonderful ,
102847:13	and I was thinking , you know , 0 it 's supposed *-1 to be a family place over near Plano Super Bowl . E_S
102847:23	and I was thinking , you know , 0 it 's supposed *-1 to be a family place over near Plano Super Bowl . E_S
102877:13	I do n't know if you tried N_S
102923:23	and , uh , for dessert we thought 0 we had just stuffed ourselves . E_S
102929:14	And , you know , they did , like the raspberry puree , just kind of like \[ in a , \+ in a \] decoration on the , N_S
102930:8	you know , how they do the plates real fancy with the decorations and then piled the berries and shaved chocolate on top of it *T*-1 E_S
102949:40	\[ \[ I do n't , \+ I 'm , \] \+ know \] N_S
102962:10	You know , \[ i- , \+ I 'm \] originally from Connecticut E_S
102965:36	and , uh , I was really amazed *-1 , you know , E_S
102967:10	You know , they were real , real pretty E_S
102970:13	I do n't know . N_S
102971:17	The restaurants down here seem like they have , uh , N_S
102976:12	And , I thought 0 I would really miss that . E_S
102985:21	but the atmosphere and service I think 0 *T*-1 , are important , uh too . E_S
102990:14	And , you know , in order *-1 to survive in this area , I think 0 *T*-2 they have *-1 to be good . E_S
102990:47	And , you know , in order *-1 to survive in this area , I think 0 *T*-2 they have *-1 to be good . E_S
103023:10	but I know 0 in some areas , \[ \[ \[ it 's really , \+ it , \] \+ it really is \] bad . E_S
103028:26	Um , I was trying *-1 to think , uh , N_S
103043:13	Well , I think 0 it *EXP*-1 would be terrible * to live in an area like that E_S
103044:17	and , unfortunately , I think 0 there are a lot of areas that *T*-1 are , \[ that , \+ that \] bad . E_S
103055:8	I think 0 it 's a bigger problem . With the car pollution , anti-pollution devices , E_S
103056:8	I think , uh , 0 air is n't as bad *ICH*-1 0 it once was *?* , from the cars , because we certainly have plenty of cars in our area . E_S
103056:74	I think , uh , 0 air is n't as bad *ICH*-1 0 it once was *?* , from the cars , because we certainly have plenty of cars in our area . E_S
103059:13	Well , I know , uh , 0 that 's been the concern in Europe . E_S
103074:8	I think 0 \[ it gives off , \+ uh , in the emissions , it gives off \] gases which *T*-1 combine up in the atmosphere , uh , and form \[ a , \+ a \] weak acid . E_S
103080:27	and after a period of time , I think 0 *T*-1 that accumulates in , uh , trees because they take it up through their roots , as well as it landing on the leaves , on surfaces , E_S
103091:31	and it was kind of pooh-poohed *-1 , you know . E_S
103101:60	It 's kind of funny because people are just petrified , at least some are *?* , at the thought of nuclear . E_S
103105:17	So , I do n't know . E_S
103111:17	So , I do n't know what the answer is *T*-1 . E_S
103121:13	I do n't know why . E_S
103126:13	Well , I know 0 it 's MUMBLEx , um , N_S
103130:22	and , uh , oddly enough I thought 0 our part of the country was ideal . E_S
103134:18	Oh . I do n't know what * to , N_S
103146:18	\[ I do n't know what , \+ uh , \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know what \] the problem is *T*-1 E_S
103146:58	\[ I do n't know what , \+ uh , \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know what \] the problem is *T*-1 E_S
103148:13	and we had thought 0 this part of the country would be ideal for solar homes and solar energy E_S
103155:21	That surprised me because I think , 0 we have a tremendous amount of , um , sunny days . E_S
103172:21	It 's just , you know , a possible solution in the future , I think 0 *T*-1 , * maybe to help in some ways . E_S
103172:48	It 's just , you know , a possible solution in the future , I think 0 *T*-1 , * maybe to help in some ways . E_S
103172:63	It 's just , you know , a possible solution in the future , I think 0 *T*-1 , * maybe to help in some ways . E_S
103176:8	It may not *?* in all ways . E_S
103177:34	Maybe they 'll come up with fusion . You know , \[ con- , \+ be able *-1 to control \] it . E_S
103178:13	I do n't know how long that 'll take *T*-1 , E_S

103192:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think , 0 with * solving some of the \[ energy , \+ future energy \] problems , we 'll probably solve some of the pollution problems as well . E_S

103200:16	Well , I do think , um , N_S
103201:40	I mean , you 've already mentioned several things , I think , uh , just the change in attitude and the fact that more people are aware 0 there is a problem and more people are interested in , uh , N_S
103216:58	I 've noticed \[ 0 students \[ are , \+ are \] much more , \+ you know , \[ young , \+ young \] people are much more \] receptive to ideas about the environment and * protecting the earth . E_S

103227:17	How horrible , you know . E_S
103250:28	Well , like , um , I do n't know , E_S
103251:23	I \[ c- , \+ \] think that I , N_S
103252:106	one of the reasons that I 'm against it *T*-1 is that , uh , um , I 'm afraid of someone losing their life , for \[ s- , \+ \] um , wrongly , E_S
103262:161	\[ one of the arguments , that \[ really , \+ I really \] actually have been kind of ambivalent about *T*-1 it , \+ but one of the arguments that *T*-5 really , uh , made me feel kind of strongly against it , \] is that , uh , you know , someone said to me once , well , * imagine if the person 0 you love *T*-2 most in the world , like your mother or something , if someone killed her ,
103266:13	But then I thought about it E_S
103267:10	and I thought , well , the loss that I would feel *T*-1 at *-2 losing my mother someone else would feel that about that person
103282:31	Well , \[ I guess , \+ you know , \[ I , \+ I \] guess \] 0 I can see it from several different perspectives , E_S

103331:29	\[ I \+ I \] mean you know 0 there there is always that chance E_S

104004:26	they 'd be , I do n't know , maybe \[ ten ounce or \+ six ounce or ten ounce . \] \[ Sort of a small size , \+ sort of a small size \]
104004:31	they 'd be , I do n't know , maybe \[ ten ounce or \+ six ounce or ten ounce . \] \[ Sort of a small size , \+ sort of a small size \]
104012:74	\[ but , \+ and \] they were packed *-1 in the old sort of six pack * stick them down , you know , uh \[ sort of , \+ sort of \] a basket type thing . E_S
104030:7	but certainly we were doing things the way 0 we think 0 we should do them now *T*-1 . E_S
104030:36	but certainly we were doing things the way 0 we think 0 we should do them now *T*-1 . E_S
104036:120	Well , it *EXP*-1 will be interesting * to see how , over the next year , this all works out *T*-2 because , like on the , uh , grass , \[ I 'm , \+ I \] know 0 your husband , uh , does n't really like the paper sacks . E_S
104040:48	\[ \[ and , \+ uh , but he , \] \+ but , you know , he \] likes *-1 to pick the grass up , too . E_S
104049:15	but I do n't believe in * throwing it into \[ the , \+ uh , the \] landfill , E_S
104064:26	Well , there 's someplace , you know , E_S
104066:86	because really , when I look at what my grass does *T*-1 \[ in , \+ in \] actually about twenty-four hours *T*-3 , uh , *-4 knowing what the farmers do *T*-2 in rural areas ,
104072:24	and then , uh , who *T*-1 knows how they process it from there *T*-2 and what they turn it into *T*-3 , E_S
104073:13	but it 's certainly usable material . E_S
104081:47	They have this day *ICH*-2 now , that *T*-1 it 's , you know , separate from the other trash pick up . E_S
104092:12	but , I think 0 I have n't been to the movie theater here in about , oh , six months , E_S
104093:19	but , uh , you know , the last movies that I 've seen *T*-1 were probably on video . E_S
104093:52	but , uh , you know , the last movies that I 've seen *T*-1 were probably on video . E_S
104128:40	\[ \[ He , \+ he , \] \+ uh , I think 0 he \] shoots off their knee caps for the most part . In the movie . E_S
104195:8	I know 0 my daughter saw that E_S
104208:15	I guess 0 maybe it would have been better if we 'd have been at the theater as opposed to , uh , * just at the house watching it \[ with , \+ with \] no one else around . E_S
104220:59	so , \[ We , \+ we \] watch a lot of movies around that category , you know \[ that she , \+ that she \] can watch *T*-1 . E_S
104234:23	LITTLE MERMAID and PETER PAN I think 0 *T*-2 \[ are , \+ are \] his two favorites that we 've got *T*-1 . E_S
104240:29	And \[ there 's some , \+ I think 0 there 's some \] good Disney movies fixing * to come out on video , uh , SHIPWRECKED . E_S
104247:22	and , boy , I ca n't think of the other one that *T*-2 's fixing *-1 to come out . E_S
104257:8	I think 0 I heard 0 that \[ was just one , \+ was just \] out . E_S
104265:26	Well , I 'm glad *-3 to know that there 's somebody else out there that *T*-1 does n't get *-2 to go to the movie theater . E_S
104275:64	and , uh , there 's so much out on video *ICH*-1 now , that it 's almost , you know , N_S
104288:8	That seems *-1 to happen . E_S
104295:8	I thought 0 that might be kind of fun 0 * to do *T*-1 . E_S
104295:18	I thought 0 that might be kind of fun 0 * to do *T*-1 . E_S
104308:23	\[ I , \+ I \] know 0 we get discount tickets where my husband works *T*-1 , E_S
104312:24	but , other than that it just seems like it 's so expensive . E_S
104331:13	I do n't think that I 've ever heard of that movie . E_S
104364:9	-ing seems *-1 to be \[ a , \+ a \] topic that *T*-2 's going *-3 to probably take about a generation *ICH*-5 *-4 to , uh , catch on , it seems 0 *T*-6 , or maybe a generation to two . E_S
104364:64	-ing seems *-1 to be \[ a , \+ a \] topic that *T*-2 's going *-3 to probably take about a generation *ICH*-5 *-4 to , uh , catch on , it seems 0 *T*-6 , or maybe a generation to two . E_S

104365:10	And we may have *-1 to do it out of necessity as far as *-2 moving that time schedule up . E_S
104366:16	Uh , it does seem *-2 to be a lot of habits 0 * to break *T*-1 . E_S
104391:37	So , \[ they , \+ they \] realized , you know , N_S
104402:29	I read in the paper this week where maybe , N_S
104403:13	I do n't know if it \[ w- , \+ was , \] N_S
104404:15	I guess 0 maybe this week someone may start *-1 getting them if the truck that *T*-2 picks them up is outfitted *-3 in time . E_S
104404:26	I guess 0 maybe this week someone may start *-1 getting them if the truck that *T*-2 picks them up is outfitted *-3 in time . E_S
104408:51	But , \[ it , \+ it \] should be starting , I would stay probably in the next month \[ if , \+ if \] everything goes that , N_S
104409:13	I 'm not sure all what we 're going *-1 to have *-2 to do *T*-3 , whether we have three separate containers , E_S
104414:8	it seemed like , uh , N_S
104421:17	but , uh , * seems like they said 0 they were just going *-1 to have a bin E_S and all different types would go in there E_S and then that they would sort it \[ as \+ as \] * needed *-2 . E_S
104425:23	\[ It , \+ it \] seemed that there was , N_S
104426:35	at the time anyway , \[ it , \+ \] the thinking was that there was too much not getting sorted * properly and that \[ at , \+ at \] the collection sites where everything 's clearly labeled *-1 *T*-2 and people that *T*-3 happen *-4 to go to that kind of trouble *-5 to do it , happen *-6 to do it pretty well , E_S uh , those are okay * to have the general public doing the sorting . E_S
104428:36	the success rate of * getting it sorted *-1 properly seemed *-2 to be poor , E_S
104433:30	But \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know , E_S
104441:38	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] know other places when they recycle *T*-1 ,
104449:32	I was brought *-1 up , uh , you know , long time ago , that they did n't even have cans . E_S
104457:13	They do n't seem *-1 to still be doing that . E_S
104466:14	and it *EXP*-3 seemed *-1 to be a very popular thing for people driving by that highway there , by our tracks to throw the bottles at the tracks and try *-2 to \[ crash , \+ you know break \] them , E_S
104466:119	and it *EXP*-3 seemed *-1 to be a very popular thing for people driving by that highway there , by our tracks to throw the bottles at the tracks and try *-2 to \[ crash , \+ you know break \] them , E_S
104480:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 kids do n't appreciate , maybe the value of money , that it 's so little that they do n't care , E_S
104480:44	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 kids do n't appreciate , maybe the value of money , that it 's so little that they do n't care , E_S
104489:41	the nickels , the dimes or what , I suppose 0 it might be quarters , fifty cent pieces in these days , that they would get *T*-1 , \[ they , \+ the kids \] just do n't seem *-2 \[ to , \+ to \] care \[ that , \+ that \] much about a small amount of money . E_S
104489:117	the nickels , the dimes or what , I suppose 0 it might be quarters , fifty cent pieces in these days , that they would get *T*-1 , \[ they , \+ the kids \] just do n't seem *-2 \[ to , \+ to \] care \[ that , \+ that \] much about a small amount of money . E_S
104497:40	so I would say 0 in the last three years , we 've probably used a lot more cans than ever before . E_S
104511:63	Since we 've had the crusher all summer , \[ we \+ , I guess 0 we \] just now maybe have a bag full that we have n't ta- ,
104512:15	oh , N_S I think 0 the kids , when we were on vacation *T*-1 , they said 0 they did take them to \[ a , \+ a \] recycling place , probably at one of the li- , N_S
104512:102	oh , N_S I think 0 the kids , when we were on vacation *T*-1 , they said 0 they did take them to \[ a , \+ a \] recycling place , probably at one of the li- , N_S
104550:33	I find that , uh , about two years is probably my max on * subscribing to one in particular E_S
104558:117	GOOD HOUSEKEEPING is the one that *T*-1 kind of sets around for \[ when , \+ uh , when \] I 'm really have time and I really want *-2 to read something *T*-3 , you know . E_S
104567:43	so I enjoy *-1 reading parts on travel in the various you know , different ones . E_S
104580:98	\[ When , \+ when \] I had my magazines at home *T*-1 , I would find that I kind of skimmed through them and looked at the pictures , you know , E_S
104581:30	and if something caught my eye , then I might read something , E_S
104585:23	but otherwise than that , you know , they were , uh , you know , not too useful to me . You know E_S
104585:46	but otherwise than that , you know , they were , uh , you know , not too useful to me . You know E_S
104585:71	but otherwise than that , you know , they were , uh , you know , not too useful to me . You know E_S
104603:10	and you think , where did I ever put that recipe *T*-1 . E_S
104607:46	But , uh , that 's mainly my , uh , whole idea on you know , short subject , uh , reading and things like this . E_S
104622:36	And I have *-1 to read the magazines , you know , such as BYTE , and COMPUTER WORLD and MAC WORLD and all of these , , uh , magazines such as that , E_S
104623:20	so I really , you know , just , N_S
104624:38	I can see that it will be a very long time , probably , before I subscribe to any magazines at home . E_S
104627:33	Well , sometimes , \[ if , \+ you know , if \] you 're \[ in transportation , \+ in public transportation \] I know that people will read them on something like that . E_S
104627:79	Well , sometimes , \[ if , \+ you know , if \] you 're \[ in transportation , \+ in public transportation \] I know that people will read them on something like that . E_S
104634:10	But I think , N_S
104652:90	\[ If I , \+ if I \] go on an airplane ride or something , I 'll stop in and pick up \[ a , \+ you know , a \] COSMOPOLITAN or something 0 * to read *T*-1 on the airplane . E_S
104657:19	But , uh , you know , that 's basically just about , N_S
104672:18	It was , you know , kind of a little bit more than what I needed *T*-1 , E_S
104674:72	\[ I \+ , when I \] bought the computer *T*-1 , all of a sudden I was receiving them , for some unknown reason , through the mail . E_S
104675:8	I think 0 they all \[ that- , \+ \] thought , well , we have a live one .
104675:37	I think 0 they all \[ that- , \+ \] thought , well , we have a live one .
104680:13	But they were wrong . E_S
104687:25	All right , I guess 0 we might as well end our conversation at this point . E_S
104707:21	but , then that kind of thinking is also tempered *-1 with \[ the , \+ the \] knowledge , or at least \[ the , \+ the \] rumor , I 'm not really sure if it 's true or not , that , uh , we 're not spending as much per , * let 's say *RNR*-2 , afflicted person on cancer . E_S

104710:8	It seems *-1 to be doing much more damage *RNR*-2 and affecting \[ much more pe- , \+ many more people *RNR*-2 \] than AIDS . E_S
104722:43	I 've never bothered *-1 to dig it out and make * sure , E_S
104726:8	we think 0 that 's the world 's worst thing E_S
104734:21	And , uh , * having thought about that for a while , N_S
104736:14	What did you think *T*-1 about that idea ? E_S
104738:49	Well , \[ \[ I , \+ I kind of , \] \+ I \] thought , well , \[ that , \+ that \] might be possible since there are a lot of men in control of that kind of thing . E_S

104739:42	But then \[ I got , \+ I got \] to *-2 thinking , 0 \[ the , \+ the \] number one killer of men seems *-1 to be the prostate E_S

104750:13	and then that seems *-1 to be one of \[ the , \+ the \] major , uh , problems that men have *T*-2 in the realm of cancer , E_S
104751:17	so , I do n't know . E_S
104758:23	well , there 's , you know , a hundred thousand per year affected * by this one E_S
104765:85	\[ They , \+ uh , you \] wish that there could just be money for all these problems because they 're all so serious , you know . E_S
104773:85	\[ I , \+ uh , I \] guess 0 \[ \[ I , \+ it , \] \+ it *EXP*-1 \] frightens me * to think of so many people \[ with , \+ with \] AIDS and with cancer E_S
104774:66	and many of those things , uh , if they 're not able *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] be insured *-2 then the country 's going *-3 to pay for it one way or the other . Whether it 's through prevention \[ or , \+ or \] treatment or , you know , * \[ just , \+ uh , just \] helping the people when they are not able *-4 to take care of themselves *T*-5 . E_S

104778:8	It seems like one way or the other we 're going *-1 to end up *-2 paying for it . E_S
104784:10	You know \[ the , \+ the \] other thought that I had *T*-1 , uh , N_S
104784:33	You know \[ the , \+ the \] other thought that I had *T*-1 , uh , N_S
104785:31	I 've had several minutes 0 * to think about this *T*-1 after I , uh , N_S

104790:25	but , the other thing that I thought of *T*-1 on this is , I wonder if there is n't enough money , uh , in our economy or in our system . E_S
104791:13	Uh , it seems like there 's so much that *T*-2 goes to things that *T*-1 do n't really do a whole lot of good . E_S
104794:109	But , we have such an affluent \[ a- , society \+ , society \] that I wonder \[ if , \+ if \] we took a little from here and there and the other if we might wind up with \[ a , \+ a \] cure for just about everything . E_S
104807:10	You know , you hear these ridiculous figures for pizza E_S
104810:50	but are they that enhancing \[ for the , \+ for the \] masses , you know . E_S
104814:8	They certainly do well for those who *T*-1 go to the symphony orchestra and all that , E_S
104836:53	\[ It 's , \+ uh , it *EXP*-2 's \] a scary thing * to know that , uh , you just do n't know what people are doing *T*-1 uh , before they go to work . E_S

104841:26	there have been so many . You know , E_S

104869:20	And I really , you know , N_S
104876:17	so why , you know , N_S
104881:45	Well , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] unfortunate , I think 0 *T*-1 , that everyone does n't have that opinion . E_S
104883:29	but , uh , in the long run , it seems to me , 0 it 's kind of like what they keep *-1 talking *T*-2 about \[ the , \+ uh , the \] AIDS testing with doctors or dentists and things and how that , you know , N_S

104908:16	Well , you would think so . E_S
104914:25	and that 's , uh , you know , N_S
104920:26	\[ I , \+ I \] would think , E_S
104923:34	People are afraid *-1 to fly now . You know , just because \[ of , \+ \] they do n't know what their pilot 's been doing *T*-2 \[ and , \+ and \] things like that E_S

104933:68	Well , \[ you , \+ where you 're \] located *-2 *T*-1 , \[ I , \+ I \] do know 0 *T*-3 Texas Instruments has random drug testing . E_S
104937:10	And I think 0 they 've had it for several years . E_S
104938:37	And their program 0 they had *T*-1 , I do n't think 0 *T*-2 had a lot of , uh , problems associated * with it , E_S
104941:25	And \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 it 's great . E_S
104946:19	Well , and , you know , if they do find someone \[ who , \+ who \] *T*-1 is , uh , having a problem with drugs E_S and they can get them the help that they need *T*-1 . As opposed to *-2 just letting the problem go on \[ with , \+ without \] any , uh , support . And whatever , N_S

104961:13	I do n't know what the crime is like *T*-1 where you are *T*-2 , E_S
104988:31	It 's best done *-1 when you have leisure time *T*-2 E_S
104999:10	But I think , uh , 0 the thing 0 I liked *T*-1 the best was , uh ,
105017:16	Nowadays I do n't think 0 I could afford the boat or the time ,
105027:28	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't know that I ever learned *-1 to drive it or anything , E_S

105032:35	and if you did n't obey them , uh you know , there were a lot of accidents , I guess . E_S
105045:13	and it was maybe fifteen , twenty acres E_S
105060:26	and they go , oh , yeah , sure , you know . E_S
105060:36	and they go , oh , yeah , sure , you know . E_S
105073:10	You know , * skiing on one and jumping around here and there E_S
105074:40	and \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] know how you can get injured *-1 *-1 doing much more than that *T*-2 E_S
105078:33	I 'd kind of like , someday , *-1 to maybe end up on a pair of skis \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-2 does n't have a , uh , well , N_S what they call *T*-3 trick skis . N_S
105091:83	but , just from what I 've seen *T*-1 , you just kind of work your way up to it and turn around real quick , you know . Grab the rope behind you and then just let * go real quick and let it whip you around . E_S
105095:22	But , uh , I do n't know , E_S
105096:5	maybe someday \[ I 'll \+ , I 'll \] get back to that \[ as , \+ after \] the kids are up and grown and the monies *ICH*-2 are there 0 * to get away for times on end , weekend or something *T*-1 . E_S
105122:8	I think so , too . E_S
105163:10	and I know 0 they 've changed it a lot and upgraded everything , E_S
105166:15	Well , you know , we went there once . E_S
105171:38	So when he said , well , this year , you know , I have a week there on \[ a , \+ a \] project *T*-1 E_S
105184:33	\[ It , \+ well , and that 's \] probably , N_S
105194:10	Did you know that next week there 's several T V shows coming from there in celebration of their anniversary . E_S
105197:8	I know 0 this is a real good time 0 * to go *T*-1 , because they are having so many activities and special shows . E_S
105207:44	Uh , so , well , if you 're working , then you 're probably on a limited amount of time per year that you can go *T*-1 . E_S
105217:23	Well , I really , I think 0 travel , N_S
105218:33	when I heard my topic today *T*-1 , I thought , okay \[ that 's my fav- , \+ that 's my favorite \] N_S
105261:63	I would have *-1 to say 0 we both end up *-2 going to Las Vegas , uh , probably once every maybe year and a half . E_S
105261:73	I would have *-1 to say 0 we both end up *-2 going to Las Vegas , uh , probably once every maybe year and a half . E_S
105274:41	and they 're recommending that you use those because they do n't know the future of Continental . E_S
105287:13	So we are thinking that we might go to Las Vegas during the winter this year sometime for just kind of a quick trip . E_S
105287:23	So we are thinking that we might go to Las Vegas during the winter this year sometime for just kind of a quick trip . E_S
105288:111	Uh , when we normally go that way *T*-1 , we like *-2 to go to California at the same time , because we really do n't get out there as often as you could *?* probably from Texas . E_S
105299:8	I think 0 that 's a good trip . E_S
105326:28	Oh , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] the way 0 * to , N_S
105331:8	I think 0 \[ our next car , \+ I would like something like \[ a , \+ an \] economy car \] that *T*-1 gets really good mileage and , uh , one that *T*-2 's really reliable . E_S
105332:24	\[ I would , \+ I think \] probably not \[ a , \+ a \] brand new car , E_S
105332:31	\[ I would , \+ I think \] probably not \[ a , \+ a \] brand new car , E_S
105333:7	but maybe something like a Nissan Sentra . Or something like that , uh , E_S
105347:16	Uh , I would think 0 kind of a subdued color would be nice . E_S
105350:10	You know , \[ a , \+ a \] navy blue or a , N_S
105358:18	Well , I do n't think 0 we 're looking for another car right now because we just bought one , E_S
105365:8	I think 0 that 's something 0 we might want *T*-1 , too , is some kind of standard transmission *ICH*-2 at least rather than automatic . E_S
105365:34	I think 0 that 's something 0 we might want *T*-1 , too , is some kind of standard transmission *ICH*-2 at least rather than automatic . E_S
105370:11	We 'll probably have *-1 to look for another second car sometime E_S
105372:22	\[ S- , \+ but \] probably real cheap , too . E_S
105376:8	I think 0 we would want one that , even though it was a compact car or whatever that *T*-1 it would still be nice enough that , uh , you could take someone in it and not be embarrassed . E_S
105382:25	\[ \[ Prob- , \+ well probably , \] \+ probably \] that would be a good idea , E_S
105382:36	\[ \[ Prob- , \+ well probably , \] \+ probably \] that would be a good idea , E_S
105389:62	So if we wanted it to take people out \[ it 's , \+ that 's \] a good thought . E_S
105402:13	well , I think 0 that 's all that we need *-1 to say *T*-2 . E_S
105418:35	but , uh , I feel that \[ it 's probably pre- , \+ it 's pretty \] good \[ if , \+ if \] they feel like there is a vast majority of the people at the company doing drugs . E_S
105422:13	Uh , I think that they thought that there was a lot of drug usage here at T I , E_S
105422:23	Uh , I think that they thought that there was a lot of drug usage here at T I , E_S
105423:10	but I think 0 our latest \[ sat- , \+ statistic \] said 0 something like ninety-nine point nine eight percent were , uh , testing negative \[ on all the dru- , \+ \[ on , \+ on \] all the testing . \] E_S
105428:28	Well , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 it 's a good idea just because I 'm opposed to to the drugs . E_S
105432:8	I think 0 it can cause a lot of problems even though they think 0 they can handle it . E_S
105432:45	I think 0 it can cause a lot of problems even though they think 0 they can handle it . E_S
105437:13	I do n't know , E_S
105443:10	So I think 0 it 's a good idea E_S

105448:13	I do n't know that their job would be at risk , E_S

105449:21	because I think 0 they may put them into some sort of a program 0 *T*-1 to get them off of drugs . E_S
105453:11	I would think that , N_S

105460:19	and , uh , you know , you go through the program E_S
105468:14	but , you know , \[ \[ I would , \+ I 'm , \] \+ I 'm \] in favor \[ of , \+ of \] that type of thing .

105518:20	so I 've , you know , had a , N_S
105526:10	and I think 0 it *EXP*-2 's good that they 're trying *-1 to start some programs down in the elementary schools . E_S
105530:14	But , you know , I think 0 they can test all 0 they want *?* for drugs you know , E_S

105535:10	and I know 0 many of them are doing it . E_S
105536:8	I know 0 my son has had *-1 to do it for both Sam 's and Wal-Mart E_S
105540:15	and I do n't know how many others *T*-1 are doing that E_S
105541:24	\[ and , \+ and \] I think 0 that 's good because so many of the kids that *T*-4 are on them are sort of bums that *T*-3 they need *-1 to get their life straightened *-2 up at an early age E_S
105551:24	and , uh , , I do n't know , E_S
105552:49	it 's just a problem that \[ p- , \+ \] no one is sure just how * to handle *T*-2 *T*-1 I think 0 *T*-3 . E_S
105552:77	it 's just a problem that \[ p- , \+ \] no one is sure just how * to handle *T*-2 *T*-1 I think 0 *T*-3 . E_S

105558:43	There 's several reason why \[ I , \+ I \] could think of *T*-1 right now why we should n't have it *T*-2 such as drug testing , E_S they say , runs approximately a thousand dollars a person every time 0 you do it *T*-1 . E_S
105594:31	So , see , \[ there , \+ you know , there 's \] different , N_S
105595:18	\[ I do n't think that \[ that 's , \+ that , \] \+ I think 0 that 's \] more of a personal view of mine other than \[ a , \+ a \] yes , sir , we should have drug testing because there 's really a problem E_S

105619:24	and \[ I , \+ you know , I \] do n't know why they both made him do that *T*-1 since it was so close together . E_S
105619:40	and \[ I , \+ you know , I \] do n't know why they both made him do that *T*-1 since it was so close together . E_S
105624:14	because , you know , if it 's a thousand dollars , that 's a thousand dollars 0 they wasted *T*-1 . E_S

105630:10	Well , maybe they run , N_S
105631:13	I do n't know , you know , E_S
105631:23	I do n't know , you know , E_S
105634:7	or maybe it 's under a health type program that *T*-1 \[ \[ it \+ it , \] \+ it \] would catch a lot of things . E_S
105744:25	But , uh , just when I thought 0 I really enjoyed my hobby *T*-1 , yours sounds great . E_S
105755:32	and I 'm about , uh , fifteen miles , probably , from downtown Cleveland , something like that . E_S
105767:27	If you ever start , * be sure and start with \[ a large piece that you can , \+ I mean a large flat plate . \] E_S
105809:13	And you 'll probably really , uh , \[ re- , \+ regain \] your enthusiasm for it once you get into \[ a , \+ a \] class again . E_S
105840:71	I do n't have *-1 to \[ worry , \+ really worry \] too much about price considerations because I , you know , N_S
105843:23	could you go to , you know , nice places , E_S
105846:10	Oh , sure , E_S
105853:56	So \[ where are your , \+ what are the \] \[ places , \+ you know , memorable places \] 0 you 've eaten *T*-1 *T*-2 ? E_S
105858:122	uh , there 's two restaurants that I particularly like *T*-1 that \[ I , \+ every time 0 I get into Texas *T*-2 or I get into Atlanta , Georgia *T*-2 , \] I make * sure 0 I go *T*-3 , E_S
105879:14	because I was thinking , N_S

105954:8	I know , N_S
105963:54	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ when I \] went *T*-1 , I thought 0 the food was not good . E_S
105970:32	Magic Time Machine is the place 0 you 're thinking of *T*-1 , E_S
105976:44	See , \[ I , \+ when I \] went *T*-1 , I thought , N_S
105984:16	but then I just thought 0 the food was over priced for what it was *T*-1 . E_S
106007:8	I think , N_S
106008:28	sometimes I 've been *?* when I thought , Well , it was n't as good *T*-1 , E_S
106010:10	and I thought , Well , this really is good . E_S
106036:13	Oh , I thought 0 sometimes they say , you know this is three minutes or whatever . E_S
106036:36	Oh , I thought 0 sometimes they say , you know this is three minutes or whatever . E_S
106045:28	and other than that , they , you know , leave you go about five minutes , E_S
106052:17	It *EXP*-1 was a pleasure * talking to you . E_S
106068:10	but I think that at some times it can be the right thing 0 * to do *T*-1 . E_S
106104:19	Uh , what do you think *T*-1 ? E_S
106136:34	So , she 's been there since August the thirteenth and seems *-1 to have adjusted pretty well . E_S
106157:14	and , you know , all kinds of physical problems , E_S
106188:13	well , I think 0 sometimes when people get *-1 to be a certain age *T*-2 , other people have *-3 to kind of help them make decisions . E_S
106188:46	well , I think 0 sometimes when people get *-1 to be a certain age *T*-2 , other people have *-3 to kind of help them make decisions . E_S
106189:12	It *EXP*-1 sure would n't have been Granny 's decision * to leave us and go back to a nursing home , E_S
106208:10	and I know 0 she 's eating the right things , E_S
106214:12	so , I think 0 she 'll adjust , E_S
106241:11	I always thought 0 it would be , N_S
106242:14	so , you know , you 'd have *-1 to hire someone if you needed *-2 to paint inside your house or something E_S
106246:10	but I know 0 I can do it . E_S
106264:29	At first I did n't realize , you know , N_S
106294:32	and so you can drip it on , you know E_S
106305:71	it *EXP*-1 's just important * to look for one that *T*-2 does n't have lead in it , you know , E_S
106332:30	I mean \[ I , \+ you know , it \] looked just like , it was the viscosity of paint thinner E_S
106337:49	and , uh , if you saw that the wood was getting wet , you know , \[ that was , \+ that was \] all 0 you needed *T*-1 . E_S
106350:8	I think though , um , 0 we 're lucky that we did n't have *-1 to do any detail work , because I do n't know if I could *?* , you know , E_S
106350:80	I think though , um , 0 we 're lucky that we did n't have *-1 to do any detail work , because I do n't know if I could *?* , you know , E_S
106350:103	I think though , um , 0 we 're lucky that we did n't have *-1 to do any detail work , because I do n't know if I could *?* , you know , E_S
106351:13	I do n't know , E_S
106354:13	I do n't know , E_S
106363:32	we had a couple of different size brushes you know ,
106381:17	so there was no major mistakes , E_S
106392:10	you know , around the windows , if you got it on the glass , we let it dry and scraped it after that E_S
106399:21	if you just , you know N_S
106404:22	but it was n't , you know , N_S
106405:13	I do n't know ,
106407:82	it 's like , if you just go slow , \[ you do n't get , \+ or at least I did n't get \] that many mistakes E_S
106411:21	I did n't make that many mistakes , E_S
106414:33	\[ and , \+ and then \] I 'd have probably rolled it on . E_S
106422:24	well , the first time it 'd probably would have taken me forever , E_S
106447:50	and \[ there was , \+ I was \] just painting because I do n't know how * to do anything else *T*-1 . E_S
106455:46	So now I feel like if I ever buy a house , I can probably paint , if nothing else . E_S
106457:8	I think 0 I could probably do it uh ,
106457:21	I think 0 I could probably do it uh ,
106463:12	But you know , I went in to a hardware store *-1 to get paint for those toys , E_S
106468:29	but I did n't realize what , you know , pain it *EXP*-2 is *T*-1 * to clean the brushes and everything , if you do n't have latex E_S
106490:8	I think 0 the women for the most part end up *-1 managing the money . E_S
106496:8	That seems *-1 to be our challenge . E_S
106515:44	and so \[ we , \+ we , \] um , set aside a certain amount *ICH*-1 each week that *T*-2 goes for things that *T*-3 have *-4 to be paid for *-5 , you know , E_S
106515:112	and so \[ we , \+ we , \] um , set aside a certain amount *ICH*-1 each week that *T*-2 goes for things that *T*-3 have *-4 to be paid for *-5 , you know , E_S
106524:77	and so I really do n't have the obligations *ICH*-2 there any more that we have *-1 to balance *T*-4 *-3 to you know , get things together for them , E_S
106542:34	and I put things *ICH*-1 on there that I think 0 I 'm not going *-2 to get to *T*-3 E_S
106554:17	but we make * sure that we just do not buy unless we really can see how we 're going *-1 to pay for it ahead *T*-2 E_S
106565:16	and now it just seems just such a large amount of money 0 * to spend *T*-1 \[ that , \+ that \] we do have a used car , E_S
106568:15	Um , do you think that it *EXP*-1 's wiser * to buy * used ? E_S
106572:100	In fact , we are in a position that most of our friends \[ why , \+ wonder why \] we just do n't go to a new car , you know , whatever *T*-1 *T*-2 , E_S
106600:19	and I said , you know how when you have a bad one *T*-1 , you say , never again *T*-2 E_S
106612:13	and we still know now that we have this car 0 * to put all the miles on *T*-1 . E_S
106616:41	This is for all the long running back and forth on , you know interstate driving and things , E_S
106617:70	and we intend *-1 to replace our other one with a much newer car in the next couple of years , or next year probably . E_S
106629:10	you know , we were going up to a larger one , E_S
106636:18	we will , you know , N_S
106637:37	and they say , Well , you 're kidding , you know . E_S
106663:25	Uh , but that depends , you know , on the individual if they can I guess have self-control . E_S
106666:13	Uh , I know 0 we tried several different ways . E_S
106689:13	and * a seems like the problem that they were having *T*-1 \[ of all the , \+ of all the \] things that *T*-3 worked was * not planning enough for the incidentals that we could n't think about *T*-2 . E_S
106689:122	and * a seems like the problem that they were having *T*-1 \[ of all the , \+ of all the \] things that *T*-3 worked was * not planning enough for the incidentals that we could n't think about *T*-2 . E_S
106694:10	You know , \[ the accid- , \+ the accidental \] fee or the car repair or the things that *T*-1 were n't supposed *-2 to be every month . E_S
106697:28	\[ I , \+ I \] could n't probably be bothered *-1 *-1 doing that every month , E_S
106719:31	You learn *-1 to get through , you know , to the end of the month E_S
106723:32	I mean , you would n't like on payday think , boy , I can go *-1 do this and that and this and that . E_S
106724:13	You kind of think this is got *-1 to str- , N_S
106749:91	And we 're going *-1 to go ahead and try *-4 to just live on what we earn *T*-2 instead of *-5 guessing ahead of what we probably will have *T*-3 next month . E_S
106761:27	Uh , there was a time when maybe we did n't take all of them off *T*-1 , E_S
106788:34	but I ca n't see that it would work for probably the majority of people . E_S
106791:10	you know , \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] good . E_S
106792:36	\[ You \+ \[ ma- , \+ \] you \] probably have a little extra than you have *-1 to have *?* , *-2 to , N_S
106793:8	you know what I 'm saying *T*-1 ? E_S
106797:55	And so , \[ that , \+ that 's \] the difference there where sometimes like I know 0 if we 've had an especially bad month and we 're just almost getting down to payday , then I think 0 if we could really budget *T*-1 , N_S
106797:121	And so , \[ that , \+ that 's \] the difference there where sometimes like I know 0 if we 've had an especially bad month and we 're just almost getting down to payday , then I think 0 if we could really budget *T*-1 , N_S
106799:8	I know 0 when we were planning *-2 to buy the new car and we had n't had a car payment in five years *T*-7 , we had *-1 to go ahead and write down each month what it was *T*-3 that every penny went for *T*-4 , *-9 to see how much *T*-8 was going *-5 to be left *-6 , E_S
106823:110	\[ I , \+ I \] started *-1 subbing just *-3 to go on a vacation and saved , all that money \[ so \+ \] because I knew that you could n't , you know , spending , five thousand dollars on a vacation , or whatever . E_S
106857:19	and you enjoyed it better probably . E_S
106863:13	And so I think that that 's difficult for most people , E_S
106866:8	I think so too . E_S
106868:14	and , you know , you never could afford anything although we could afford everything if he wanted *-1 to *?* .
106877:8	I think 0 you 're probably much ahead of me there E_S
106877:21	I think 0 you 're probably much ahead of me there E_S
106889:10	And I think though that we need *-1 to have some liquid *ICH*-3 around that you do n't have *-2 to go through the company *-5 to get *T*-4 . E_S
106893:8	You know ? N_S
106905:8	I think 0 the most , 0 \[ my , \+ \] we 're looking at cars now , uh , we ever spent *T*-1 for a new car was like six thousand dollars . E_S
106912:39	My husband said the other day 0 it *EXP*-2 was the worst mistake 0 we ever did *T*-1 * to buy a new car because it was n't worth it from the day after . E_S
106919:10	you know , we 've been \[ rather \+ rather \] frugal \[ in that . \+ In that \] respect . E_S
106931:10	do you think 0 we 've been here to in- , N_S
106937:21	Um , I do n't really think 0 we have anything in the works as of yet . E_S
106942:80	and , uh , the closest thing 0 we have *T*-1 are bins like out in front of Wal-Mart that *T*-2 show , you know , plastics , paper liter bottles , et cetera , et cetera . E_S
106955:8	it may have even spread all over the whole town , E_S
106965:48	and you put your bottles *ICH*-1 in it and paper and , uh , you know , all those things \[ that wh- , \+ \] E_S
106967:10	You know , anything that *T*-1 can be recycled *-3 you just put *T*-2 in that bin . E_S
106979:27	And , uh , oh , I do n't know , E_S
106980:28	I guess 0 they 're , you know , clear bottles . E_S
106984:19	So , um , you know a lot of people do have those separated *-1 . E_S
106993:65	And , uh , \[ they 're , \+ they 're \] actually going *-1 to extend it , I think , one of these days maybe to apartment complexes E_S
106993:82	And , uh , \[ they 're , \+ they 're \] actually going *-1 to extend it , I think , one of these days maybe to apartment complexes E_S
107006:20	Uh , we , you know , N_S
107013:35	and she goes and cashes them in because , you know , N_S
107039:14	So , you know , that 's about all \[ the , \+ \] that we 're doing *T*-1 here . E_S
107041:118	they need to a lot a more community awareness of just what is it *EXP*-3 mean *T*-4 * to recycle , and what can you recycle *T*-1 and what you ca n't *?* *T*-2 . Because , you know , not a lot of people do really know \[ what , \+ you know , what \] it 's for *T*-5 . E_S
107041:144	they need to a lot a more community awareness of just what is it *EXP*-3 mean *T*-4 * to recycle , and what can you recycle *T*-1 and what you ca n't *?* *T*-2 . Because , you know , not a lot of people do really know \[ what , \+ you know , what \] it 's for *T*-5 . E_S

107048:25	And , of course , there you know you have a specific place 0 * to put your paper *T*-1 . E_S
107054:36	Um , and \[ it 's , \+ uh , I think 0 it \] started out *-1 to be , um , just kind of a test , a pilot project . E_S
107060:13	I do n't know if it 's done *-1 by a private company or not . E_S
107061:8	It may be *?* *-1 . E_S
107078:14	Because , you know , phone books are pretty , N_S
107084:13	And sometimes you might have two or three . E_S
107095:20	It just , you know , there 's not a whole lot . E_S
107099:20	And there are , you know , some places that *T*-1 will set up you know for old newspapers and stuff . E_S
107099:53	And there are , you know , some places that *T*-1 will set up you know for old newspapers and stuff . E_S
107125:21	Now , aluminum I do n't know . E_S
107126:8	They may be coming out *-1 ahead . E_S
107127:10	But I know , for a fact that the paper , uh , on that end they 're not *?* , you know . E_S
107127:65	But I know , for a fact that the paper , uh , on that end they 're not *?* , you know . E_S
107140:13	I ca n't think of anything else . E_S
107142:65	I ca n't *?* either . Because \[ we 're , \+ we 're \] at a very , you know , beginning stages , E_S
107170:15	So whenever I think of family reunions *T*-1 , N_S
107176:23	So people talk about , you know , big family reunions E_S
107177:10	and I think , like N_S
107178:62	I have a friend who *T*-1 just went to , like , Wyoming to some big ranch , you know , where like there were four hundred people for their family reunion *T*-2 . E_S
107195:10	you know , when I go home *T*-2 I try *-1 to see the families , as much of the family as I can *?* E_S
107200:41	And I grew up in a real \[ not , \+ I think 0 *T*-1 not \] normal setting . E_S
107206:14	and , you know , like I said there would be \[ thirty , \+ you know , thirty \] people , E_S
107206:55	and , you know , like I said there would be \[ thirty , \+ you know , thirty \] people , E_S
107224:50	so * planning our family \[ reunio- , \+ reunion \] was very easy , you know . E_S
107257:15	Oh , and I know somebody that *T*-1 lives there , E_S
107264:10	well , maybe they did n't mention it because it 's just kind of a fact of life around here . E_S
107268:8	They probably just take it for granted then . E_S
107271:41	If they lived here , a lot of people 0 I know *T*-1 just say , oh , I just stomp on them . E_S
107297:33	\[ I have *-1 to , \+ you know I have *-2 to \] say 0 that 's not exactly my favorite thing either really . E_S
107300:13	I do n't know . E_S
107302:10	and I thought , oh , this is going *-1 to be interesting . E_S
107308:17	But although I do know 0 a lot of my friends do like all the gardening work . N_S
107322:13	I do n't know how yours has been *T*-1 . E_S
107341:10	and I think 0 we 'll probably experience some of your weather although I think 0 they have more humidity . E_S
107341:23	and I think 0 we 'll probably experience some of your weather although I think 0 they have more humidity . E_S
107341:48	and I think 0 we 'll probably experience some of your weather although I think 0 they have more humidity . E_S
107342:56	But , um , as far as the gardening and things like that goes *?* I do n't know , uh , \[ too much , \+ too much \] about , uh , how much I really \[ r- , \+ \] do enjoy it myself *T*-1 . E_S
107361:18	and so that I think 0 *T*-1 really , um , hampered it a little bit . E_S
107364:48	And , uh , if you have that on a regular basis in Texas , I think 0 I would go with something very dry *-1 to keep it off , you know . E_S
107364:99	And , uh , if you have that on a regular basis in Texas , I think 0 I would go with something very dry *-1 to keep it off , you know . E_S
107368:42	\[ But , \+ uh , and \] with children , um , you probably do n't have time *ICH*-2 anyhow 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] get into it *T*-1 . E_S
107388:75	Uh , hopefully they 'll give a subject 0 I like *T*-1 *ICH*-3 one of these times . Something 0 I really know a lot about *T*-2 . E_S
107413:10	Do you know the question for today ? E_S
107419:10	Do you think 0 this is vital important ? E_S
107426:13	Um , I think that , uh , it 's kind of discouraging to , uh , N_S
107430:23	they have no idea , you know , even that there 's an election E_S
107439:38	And I have often wondered \[ if , \+ if \] maybe that would help the situation . E_S
107440:13	I do n't know . E_S
107442:18	Well , that 's a thought . E_S
107444:36	Well , can you come up with anything else that maybe we could do *T*-1 to these people ? E_S
107447:13	I do n't know E_S
107449:23	Um , oh , I had a thought just a second ago E_S
107454:45	Um , \[ \[ one thing that I- , \+ that I think \] \+ probably one of the reasons that \] people do n't vote more *T*-1 is because they do n't know the candidates . E_S

107456:80	that 's one thing that I have learned *T*-1 \[ in *-2 w- , \+ working in \] elections and things is , you know , 0 sometimes even when you work for someone *T*-3 you do n't really know what they 're like *T*-4 . E_S

107457:8	I know 0 there 's been a couple of people that we voted for *T*-1 and worked for E_S
107462:34	Uh , \[ and , \+ and \] I 'm not sure how you go about *-1 really finding out what people are really like *T*-2 before you vote for them *T*-3 . E_S
107470:13	I do n't know why we are so complacent *T*-1 , E_S
107472:13	* Right or wrong I 'm going *-1 to cast a ballot E_S
107479:26	I 've just lost a train of thought that I had *T*-1 . E_S
107496:8	I think 0 that 's an excellent idea because then people really have *-1 to think about it . E_S
107496:51	I think 0 that 's an excellent idea because then people really have *-1 to think about it . E_S
107499:19	\[ what do you think \+ and this is not one of our questions but what do you think *T*-1 \] of this no excuse absentee balloting ? E_S

107502:18	Uh , I 'm not sure if I 'm familiar with that , or not . E_S
107507:11	I 'm sure 0 all over the State of Texas now you have three weeks 0 * to go for absentee balloting *T*-1 . E_S
107515:13	Oh , I think 0 that 's great . E_S
107520:15	Actually , you know , my husband has run for office before E_S
107521:71	and sometimes it *EXP*-1 's nice * to be able * to go ahead of time and vote because , you know , if you 're going *-2 to be tied up that day , uh , * campaigning or whatever it might be . Um , 0 that \[ kind of , \+ just kind of \] takes that load off , you know , E_S

107540:15	and I do n't know why we could n't have duplicate voting on some of this *T*-1 . E_S
107542:43	Well , hopefully \[ once they have , \+ uh , you know , once they 've \] checked them off the list N_S \[ they , \+ they \] do have *-1 to check them off a list when they vote *T*-2 E_S
107545:8	I know . E_S
107550:10	you know . We , N_S
107558:22	and , uh , I do n't think 0 I 've ever even been in one . E_S
107563:77	when we were like \[ in , \+ in \] our teen ages *T*-2 E_S we 'd go on Sundays and visit , you know , the older people . E_S
107569:15	So I kind of know \[ how it *EXP*-4 is * to , \+ how *-1 to \] decide if you want *-2 to put somebody in a rest home *T*-3 E_S
107570:62	or , um , like \[ we , \+ I mean we 've \] had those discussions , you know , about should we put her in \[ or \+ \] because she 's pretty senile E_S

107627:13	I do n't know . E_S
107628:44	I mean , \[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] think 0 my parents would *?* E_S
107637:13	I do n't know . E_S
107639:15	but I do n't think 0 I would do it to my parents personally . E_S
107641:8	I know at this , N_S
107642:8	I know 0 I feel like I would never do that with my parents either , you know . E_S
107642:58	I know 0 I feel like I would never do that with my parents either , you know . E_S
107647:75	and I just really feel bad for the guy who *T*-1 his whole life is different *ICH*-2 now E_S and , than he thought 0 it would be *?* . E_S
107653:23	and he 's got , you know , seven brothers and sisters E_S

107678:45	so if my parents do need *-1 to live with someone , it will probably be with me because all my brothers and sisters will be having teenagers *ICH*-3 around and everything 0 * to care for *T*-2 . You know , E_S
107678:124	so if my parents do need *-1 to live with someone , it will probably be with me because all my brothers and sisters will be having teenagers *ICH*-3 around and everything 0 * to care for *T*-2 . You know , E_S
107688:8	You know what I mean *T*-1 ? E_S
107694:27	But I wonder how much , you know , if one of us is going *-1 to have *-2 to quit work someday or retire early or something . E_S
107698:8	You think about it E_S
107700:13	I do n't know . E_S

107706:125	And , It 's really more of \[ a , \+ um , like a \] respect issue \[ th- , \+ \] that the \[ older , \+ older \] people in other countries that I 've been to *T*-2 seem to really have a lot more respect for the elderly people E_S
107709:27	\[ and , \+ and \] they really seem as wise E_S
107716:14	And , you know , it 's
107718:12	but you know , it 's just funny E_S
107727:10	You know , even if they 're in good health it 's incredible . E_S
107733:7	and maybe they should *?* , you know because we 're all going *-1 to get old someday . E_S
107733:26	and maybe they should *?* , you know because we 're all going *-1 to get old someday . E_S
107738:8	I know . E_S
107754:32	Well this is a subject that you never think 0 you 'll be assigned *-1 to *T*-2 . One that *T*-3 kind of comes up when you 've lost \[ it , \+ the \[ others , \+ other \] subjects *T*-4 . \] E_S
107758:31	Um , as I was sitting there , I thought , 0 the weather 's been perfect . E_S
107759:13	I do n't know much 0 * to say *T*-1 about it . E_S
107760:42	\[ It 's , \+ uh , it 's , \] you know , N_S
107778:19	That 's the only thing wrong 0 I can find *T*-1 with it . E_S
107817:24	and \[ they , \+ you know , they \] have tons of canyons where the leaves change *T*-1 E_S
107826:64	and they actually printed out maps of routes 0 you could take *T*-1 so you would get maximum leaf exposure . E_S
107838:14	that 's for sure . E_S
107840:13	I do n't know if I 've been spoiled . E_S
107841:18	I 've been *-1 thinking 0 it 's getting cold * sooner than normal . E_S
107844:8	I think 0 it is *?* , E_S
107881:28	I mean , we used *-1 to think 0 they were pansies , E_S
107887:17	So , well , I think 0 we 've discussed it good enough today . E_S
107889:8	I think so . E_S
107909:11	so you probably have a job 0 you need *-1 to get to *T*-2 pretty soon . E_S
107943:51	so , I 'm going *-1 to be dressing just in casual slacks and T-shirts , probably not blue jeans , but little bit short of that , \[ just , \+ just \] tennis shoes and play clothes . E_S
107945:22	Well , around there you can probably wear , uh , T-shirts and other things , E_S
107963:34	and as the day , uh , warms up , we may go to light jackets , E_S
107967:15	but I do n't think 0 there 's an escape from light jackets . E_S
107997:56	and then if I have \[ a , \+ a \] meeting of people that I know *T*-1 , I can be very casual in the evening . E_S
108015:8	I think , uh , 0 years ago , I used *-1 to be far more , uh , committed to the idea \[ of , \+ of \] a dress code E_S
108021:18	Well , \[ I think 0 that 's , \+ I think 0 that 's \] great . E_S
108021:39	Well , \[ I think 0 that 's , \+ I think 0 that 's \] great . E_S
108022:8	I think 0 that 's good . E_S
108040:21	and she would not have even probably owned a pair of tennis shoes after she got out of high school , E_S
108049:39	Well , there 's not a lot more 0 I can think of *T*-1 0 * to discuss *T*-2 on clothing . E_S
108052:15	there , you know , N_S
108060:71	of course , like I said , if my husband 's going downtown , he 's got the whole , uh , you know , \[ the dress \+ men 's dress shoes \] E_S
108070:11	I 'm sure 0 they are *?* there . E_S
108074:11	I 'm sure 0 they are *?* . E_S
108078:11	I 'm sure 0 that true . E_S
108111:8	I think 0 it promotes good family values , E_S
108116:10	You know , it 's funny how you can just get in a mode where you only watch certain shows *T*-1 *T*-2 E_S
108116:64	You know , it 's funny how you can just get in a mode where you only watch certain shows *T*-1 *T*-2 E_S
108121:19	and , uh , you know , \[ there 's , so \+ there 's \] only a few \[ that I , \+ that I \] like *-1 to watch *T*-2 routinely . E_S
108139:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 basically , \[ they \+ \[ pr- , same thing , \+ \] they \] promote family values . E_S
108146:89	Uh , \[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 I like the shows that *T*-1 really have a real sense of , uh , I do n't know , honesty or sort of a purity value , I guess 0 *T*-2 . E_S
108163:47	I mean , if you want *-1 to go all time favorite show , probably one of them was LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE E_S
108174:47	uh , and so many of them nowadays , like I said , I think 0 *T*-1 are just , um N_S
108180:42	like I said , the risque stuff , just I guess 0 they think 0 that 's what people want *-1 to watch *T*-2 . E_S
108189:19	but , uh , you know , Richie always used *-1 to be \[ so , \+ you know , just so \] honest and pure I guess 0 *T*-2 , E_S

108193:33	and when he left the show *T*-1 , you know , \[ that , \+ \] it seemed *-2 to be missing that part of it E_S
108193:56	and when he left the show *T*-1 , you know , \[ that , \+ \] it seemed *-2 to be missing that part of it E_S
108201:17	so , I do n't know , E_S
108203:11	There always seems *-1 to be that kind of value in there somewhere . E_S
108212:66	Um , \[ I , \+ I \] enjoy those also , almost \[ as , \+ as \] much to a certain extent . E_S
108228:10	Uh , probably the Pirates , E_S
108234:19	but , uh , you know , \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] annoyed that the Rangers got rid *-1 of him , E_S
108263:26	\[ \[ they , \+ you know , they \] \+ they 've \] come from so far down , E_S
108276:5	maybe they 'll make it ,
108277:13	I do n't know E_S
108284:14	and , you know , that * getting back to the point that you made *T*-1 , that 's really true , E_S
108286:33	and her daughter was talking about birth control , you know E_S
108291:14	and , you know , she 's only seven years old , E_S
108295:32	so many of them now , um , you know , it just seems like they feel like they have *-1 to stick that stuff in , E_S
108295:43	so many of them now , um , you know , it just seems like they feel like they have *-1 to stick that stuff in , E_S
108296:31	\[ and \+ and , \] uh , you know , \[ \[ I 'm , \+ you know , I 'm , \] \+ I 'm \] an adult E_S

108312:26	well \[ that , \+ that \] seems *-1 to be more our values , too , E_S
108313:71	like the WONDER YEARS , \[ I , \+ I \] mean , it 's kind of risque stuff \[ for , \+ maybe for \] teenagers , E_S
108314:10	you know , \[ or , \+ and \] you can kind of relate to it you know , E_S
108314:56	you know , \[ or , \+ and \] you can kind of relate to it you know , E_S
108318:13	I do n't know , E_S
108325:19	but , uh , you know , I agree with you , E_S
108328:77	like a lot of them that *T*-1 used *-3 to be considered *-2 risque , like THREE 'S COMPANY and stuff , I think 0 \[ they , \+ they \] maintained , N_S
108329:52	people would watch them because N_S \[ there was that , \+ uh , you know , there was really \] the period that *T*-1 was going on there , N_S
108335:23	but as soon as , you know , he went *-1 to move in with another girl , the show just died E_S
108345:31	\[ I , um , \+ I \] was thinking about it for a long time , E_S
108370:13	I do n't think 0 they have a whole lot 0 *-2 to say *T*-1 , even . E_S
108436:33	I like easy listening , just kind of , you know , N_S
108454:73	Um . The thing about country western that I do n't enjoy *T*-1 \[ is \+ is , \] 0 * does n't seem *-2 to be any imagination behind it E_S
108466:17	They just play a certain number of chords E_S
108470:15	the drummer plays a certain beat , E_S
108484:57	you ca n't understand what they 're saying *T*-1 on some of those songs which *T*-2 probably is just as well on some of them , too . E_S
108503:51	while I was waiting for you to connect , \[ I , \+ I \] thought of a couple of menus , E_S
108505:10	You know if it 's informal I 'd probably choose something , I mean , just like hamburgers or steaks out on the grill because that 's a lot of fun , especially this time of year where it 's so nice out *T*-1 . E_S
108505:32	You know if it 's informal I 'd probably choose something , I mean , just like hamburgers or steaks out on the grill because that 's a lot of fun , especially this time of year where it 's so nice out *T*-1 . E_S
108515:29	Um , if it was formal I 'd probably go with something like a chicken breast or lasagna or something . E_S
108517:13	but I 'd probably go with lasagna , a green salad , and garlic bread . E_S
108530:69	Then I have some from like church that *T*-1 are more family recipes that *T*-2 are more useful . You know , budget cookbooks , E_S
108548:43	Well , \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] think 0 we come \[ from , \+ from \] different backgrounds , uh , E_S
108554:23	so , it diff- , you know , N_S
108566:62	What we 've found *T*-1 very useful is a book called * THE THIRTY MINUTE COOKBOOK , E_S I think 0 that 's the title , by Marion Burroughs E_S
108571:12	, you know , the whole meal N_S
108587:123	\[ \[ \[ But they 're , \+ but they 're , \] \+ but they 're \] interesting \+ they 're interesting \] menus , um , combinations that \[ you would n't have , \+ \] nobody thought of *T*-1 . E_S
108600:7	and probably some yogurt was in there . E_S
108608:55	Uh , \[ \[ \[ and that , \+ and that was , \] \+ you know , that 's , \] \+ \[ that , \+ that 's \] \] certain 0 you can do in thirty minutes . E_S
108608:99	Uh , \[ \[ \[ and that , \+ and that was , \] \+ you know , that 's , \] \+ \[ that , \+ that 's \] \] certain 0 you can do in thirty minutes . E_S
108612:31	But there are a whole lot of , you know , N_S
108621:53	I find 0 a lot of the cookbooks \[ that , \+ I do n't know , that \] you buy *T*-1 over the counter ask for really strange ingredients , or things 0 I do n't keep *T*-2 on hand all the time E_S
108626:25	and our budget 's set , you know , at this time , E_S
108648:30	Well , you had said dinner , you know , you know , E_S
108648:40	Well , you had said dinner , you know , you know , E_S
108655:45	the inspiration was a combination of Julia Child for the dessert , you know , a chocolate mousse recipe and a sort of MUMBLEx cookbook which *T*-1 has a recipe for a thing called * chicken marabella um , which *T*-2 is this wonderful thing 0 you can do *T*-3 , um , E_S
108688:10	Well , maybe a little more leisure time 0 * to do it *T*-1 . E_S
108688:22	Well , maybe a little more leisure time 0 * to do it *T*-1 . E_S
108692:13	I do n't know , E_S
108694:16	\[ that 's probably , \+ that 's \] true , E_S
108696:43	\[ and we , \+ and they \] wo n't eat , you know , too many different foods right now . E_S
108709:18	they 'd , you know , N_S
108731:16	Talk to you later maybe . E_S
108791:40	Well , that was one of the things 0 I was thinking about *T*-1 in school , um , E_S
108806:10	and I think 0 that would have , uh , played a real big part of my decision E_S
108817:35	and so I was going to school for , you know , just a few hundred dollars a semester , E_S
108829:10	so I think 0 that would be one thing 0 I would definitely consider *T*-1 * try *-6 to find a school within the state that , um , I liked *T*-3 well enough *-2 to attend . E_S
108843:42	so depending on what your major is *T*-1 , or medical , you might want *-2 to \[ atteck- , some , \+ um , attend somewhere \] like Tech E_S
108849:13	well some schools may even give you financial aid , where another one wo n't *?* *T*-1 . E_S
108892:51	but then after that , I was on my own , *-1 working and , you know , trying *-2 to go to school on my own . E_S
108904:13	I do n't know if those are still available or not , E_S
108909:24	but , uh , I 'm not exactly sure which ones they are *T*-1 and how much , \[ they , \+ you know , they \] generally run *T*-2 . E_S
108909:74	but , uh , I 'm not exactly sure which ones they are *T*-1 and how much , \[ they , \+ you know , they \] generally run *T*-2 . E_S
108914:30	it was just based *-1 on , you know , how much your tuition costs *T*-2 and everything , E_S
108932:26	and , uh , something that *T*-1 might play a part is the size of the college . E_S
108944:48	\[ and \+ and \] they just give you a teacher 's assistants , you know E_S
108958:18	Um , I did n't know that . E_S
108962:90	Um . Well , I guess 0 the only comparison 0 I had ever heard *T*-1 was between \[ a , \+ a \] Christian college , because I thought about *-2 attending Abilene Christian instead of Texas Tech E_S
108974:37	But I guess 0 some of the other smaller colleges \[ might , \+ might \] be a lot different . E_S
108974:45	But I guess 0 some of the other smaller colleges \[ might , \+ might \] be a lot different . E_S
108976:41	Um . Oh , \[ I , \+ at State , I \] think 0 *T*-2 it *EXP*-1 's just a waste of somebody 's money * to go there E_S
108980:31	it 's really a shame because of , you know , the instruction E_S
108984:44	um , I 'd rather *-1 go to any other college , you know , in the state , E_S
109022:8	I think 0 that has been the major change , is that , women feel 0 they need *-1 to go out and do this , E_S
109029:8	I know it , E_S
109030:27	and \[ \[ I , \+ I think , \] \+ I think \] 0 that 's really sad , because I think 0 there 's going *-2 to be a generation of kids that *T*-1 are going *-3 to grow up * raised *-4 by somebody else . E_S
109030:41	and \[ \[ I , \+ I think , \] \+ I think \] 0 that 's really sad , because I think 0 there 's going *-2 to be a generation of kids that *T*-1 are going *-3 to grow up * raised *-4 by somebody else . E_S

109046:59	But , \[ \[ I , \+ I ca n't , \] \+ I ca n't \] help but think that eventually the pendulum 's going *-1 to swing back the other way again . E_S
109048:15	Well , you know , it 's interesting , because when I heard the topic *T*-1 , I was thinking , uh , N_S
109048:62	Well , you know , it 's interesting , because when I heard the topic *T*-1 , I was thinking , uh , N_S
109049:75	this summer Oprah had a T V show about wives that *T*-1 refused *-2 to go to work , and how their husbands thought 0 they were terrible *T*-3 , E_S
109066:26	and , \[ it , \+ you know , it \] was almost from the audience participation it was almost a social issue , you know E_S
109066:77	and , \[ it , \+ you know , it \] was almost from the audience participation it was almost a social issue , you know E_S
109078:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 too many people feel 0 they need *-1 to live a more extravagant life-style than necessary E_S
109082:15	uh , you know , to , N_S
109083:28	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't think 0 , you know , the kids do n't benefit from the bigger house and the fancier cars , \[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ and \] this type of thing . E_S
109083:41	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't think 0 , you know , the kids do n't benefit from the bigger house and the fancier cars , \[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ and \] this type of thing . E_S

109089:48	\[ \[ I , \+ uh , I , \] \+ I \] do n't know , E_S
109091:10	and I think 0 it 's going *-1 to have *-2 to swing back the other way , because I think 0 we 're going *-3 to have an awful lot of kids who *T*-4 are going *-5 to have major problems from all this . E_S
109091:65	and I think 0 it 's going *-1 to have *-2 to swing back the other way , because I think 0 we 're going *-3 to have an awful lot of kids who *T*-4 are going *-5 to have major problems from all this . E_S
109094:15	well , you know , \[ I , \+ as I \] said , I teach school E_S
109098:30	and , gosh , I 'm trying *-1 to think , E_S
109099:13	I do n't know , E_S
109100:42	I have \[ one woman , \+ one mother \] that I know 0 *T*-1 is home , E_S
109120:17	and , uh , I know 0 there are n't very many , N_S
109122:39	but \[ \[ do you see , \+ um , you know , do you ever , \] \+ do you ever \] see problems , you know , that you feel you know , that the kids are left *-2 *-3 alone too much *T*-1 , E_S
109122:86	but \[ \[ do you see , \+ um , you know , do you ever , \] \+ do you ever \] see problems , you know , that you feel you know , that the kids are left *-2 *-3 alone too much *T*-1 , E_S
109122:107	but \[ \[ do you see , \+ um , you know , do you ever , \] \+ do you ever \] see problems , you know , that you feel you know , that the kids are left *-2 *-3 alone too much *T*-1 , E_S
109150:14	and , you know , I have lots of kids , because they know 0 I 'm there late E_S
109150:44	and , you know , I have lots of kids , because they know 0 I 'm there late E_S
109156:28	And that 's frightening , because , you know , the , N_S
109159:55	and we 're talking about what the girl said *T*-1 in class , E_S and , you know , what *T*-1 's right because there 's no mother at home E_S
109172:72	or do you feel 0 there 's just going *-1 to be a big push \[ to , \+ \] uh you know , \[ for , \+ for \] \[ more , \+ more \] and more day care type situations ? E_S
109174:28	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't know . E_S
109185:21	and then when , you know , they go on one salary *T*-3 , will they be able *-2 to sustain what their life-style is *T*-1 . E_S
109190:14	and , you know , I agree with you , E_S
109205:43	and it *EXP*-1 was very easy * \[ to , \+ you know , to \] put everything out there , E_S
109226:8	I think 0 that 's a good excuse . E_S
109227:53	You need *-1 to get into \[ the \+ the \] system a little more and know where * to take things *T*-2 . E_S
109234:18	We 've been here probably two and a half years , E_S
109239:10	so I think 0 we 're doing well . E_S
109259:15	but I did n't know where * to take them *T*-1 . E_S
109263:8	I think 0 there 's \[ a , \+ a \] service station there . E_S
109283:8	it seems like ever since we 've moved here we 've been hearing that , you know it 's coming in a couple of months , E_S
109283:55	it seems like ever since we 've moved here we 've been hearing that , you know it 's coming in a couple of months , E_S
109286:12	and , I think 0 it 's been delayed *-1 . E_S
109290:8	I think 0 it was originally scheduled *-1 for February , E_S
109291:93	but the trucks that *T*-1 were supposed * to do it , there 's been some problems with *T*-4 from what I 've read *T*-3 in , you know , the mail that we get *T*-2 E_S
109306:58	I feel guilty 0 we do n't recycle \[ our , \+ our \] milk containers because they seem like a big waste . E_S
109320:10	and I think 0 that 's when \[ I 'll , \+ I 'll \] start *-2 doing the plastic , too *T*-1 . E_S
109329:44	I 've gotten used to *-1 washing \[ the , \+ you know , the , \] um , salad dressing bottles and things like that , E_S
109341:28	\[ I , \+ I \] did n't know \[ ho- , \+ what \] kind of an idea * to give her *T*-1 for , N_S
109343:66	Oh , when we first \[ were , \+ were \] here *T*-1 , it was like we 'd take maybe \[ a , \+ oh , a \] grocery sack full or maybe two grocery sacks full , E_S
109343:103	Oh , when we first \[ were , \+ were \] here *T*-1 , it was like we 'd take maybe \[ a , \+ oh , a \] grocery sack full or maybe two grocery sacks full , E_S
109360:8	I think , 0 more people \[ are \+ are \] recycling . E_S
109368:83	and whatever pop we drink *T*-1 , we used *-2 to take the boys out for a bike ride , and pick up the litter , you know , \[ the , \+ the \] cans E_S
109381:15	Well , the boys think 0 it 's fun ,
109397:13	but , \[ may , \+ maybe \] they 'll beat me \[ and , \+ and \] do the city wide first . E_S
109397:21	but , \[ may , \+ maybe \] they 'll beat me \[ and , \+ and \] do the city wide first . E_S
109406:14	that 's for sure . E_S
109424:15	They , you know , N_S
109435:7	and maybe we 'll get on line again . E_S
109515:10	you know , lots of shade and squirrels and birds and real pretty , E_S
109549:60	Well , they advertised it as a three bedroom house because it has a built on addition room , you know E_S
109568:10	you know , it 's kind of a catch all room . E_S
109571:14	But it *ICH*-3 sure is nice * to have it when the kids come over *-1 to play *T*-2 E_S
109588:17	and so , you know , they can share a room and , uh , make for more space that way . E_S
109603:59	so , um , and right now we have their clothes on , uh , like double racks , you know , in the closet E_S
109612:70	but they 're just about *-1 to get too tall , where the dresses are beginning *-2 to drag *T*-3 you know , E_S
109636:18	so I do n't really know , E_S
109639:13	Well , I think 0 I 've heard a lot , uh , about Coppell schools , that they 're real good E_S
109651:13	I do n't think so , E_S
109717:27	it was redone *-1 at the time probably when earth tones were in *T*-2 E_S
109737:10	you know , so , uh , that 's worked out good . E_S
109774:15	Well , you know , now we have that new mall in Lewisville E_S
109825:31	\[ we , \+ at the time we \] thought 0 we might buy a mobile home , E_S
109825:41	\[ we , \+ at the time we \] thought 0 we might buy a mobile home , E_S
109849:8	* seems like they take forever any more , E_S
109880:11	You know , I think 0 it 's kind of coming back around to that , do n't you , E_S
109880:19	You know , I think 0 it 's kind of coming back around to that , do n't you , E_S
109882:30	but I guess 0 more than anything I think 0 maybe people were just kind of wanting *-1 to have the choice of what they could do *T*-2 , you know E_S
109882:37	but I guess 0 more than anything I think 0 maybe people were just kind of wanting *-1 to have the choice of what they could do *T*-2 , you know E_S

109886:13	I do n't know , E_S
109887:16	I mean I think 0 sometimes some of \[ the , \+ the \] women 's lib though , is kind of like they wanted it all , you know , E_S
109887:95	I mean I think 0 sometimes some of \[ the , \+ the \] women 's lib though , is kind of like they wanted it all , you know , E_S
109892:36	\[ \[ I do n't , \+ I do n't think that you can have , \] \+ I mean , there 's no way 0 I could have \] a career and then be the kind of mom that I want *-2 to be *T*-1 *T*-3 E_S
109915:44	\[ I , \+ I \] just am fortunate because I do n't know a real lot of moms that *T*-1 get *-2 to stay home , E_S
109917:14	and , you know , these people have secretaries and these high power jobs , E_S
109918:13	and it just seems like , um , N_S
109920:33	and , uh , \[ \[ \[ I just think , \+ I , \] \+ I , \] \+ I just do n't agree with that . \] E_S
109921:8	I think 0 it should be that people should get back to * staying home \[ and , \+ and \] being \[ family , \+ more family \] oriented \[ than , \+ than \] not . E_S
109922:10	You know , it seems like everybody 's always so busy with everything that they 're doing *T*-1 that there 's no time for this and that and the other , E_S
109922:18	You know , it seems like everybody 's always so busy with everything that they 're doing *T*-1 that there 's no time for this and that and the other , E_S
109923:49	and I hope 0 it just does n't get *-1 to where , you know , there 's \[ more women , \+ more and more women \] going into the work force *T*-2 . E_S
109926:109	I mean , but , \[ I , \+ I \] hate for them to make people *ICH*-1 feel bad that *T*-2 have *-3 to work , too , * saying , you know , 0 you should stay home , you know , otherwise your children are n't going *-4 to , you know , turn out , or whatever because that 's not fair to , you know , like the single moms that *T*-5 have *-6 to work , E_S

109934:18	I mean , I think 0 it 's got *-1 to be a personal choice , E_S
109941:19	and , uh , you know , well , I had my baby with me , E_S
109945:23	but it 's like , you know , here these people are *T*-1 , E_S
109947:14	and , you know , they kind of looked at me like I was from the dark ages , you know , \[ like I , \+ \] because I did n't have really all that much 0 * to talk about *T*-1 , uh , where career and things like that were concerned *T*-2 , E_S

109966:31	men do n't treat you like you do n't know anything , * generally speaking . E_S

110015:13	and my dog thinks 0 he 's a mother turtle , and always has his nose all around my turtle box , E_S
110032:20	but they 're not very well known *-1 in this country , E_S
110042:17	and they range from probably ten to sixteen pounds E_S

110080:32	\[ We 've , \+ uh , we \] thought probably 0 our neighborhood in Houston had more of this breed than any other place just because of , um , the family that *T*-1 had them \[ and , \+ and \] bred them . E_S

113839:8	I think that , um , in general the whole immigration policy is n't quite as open as it should be *?* . E_S That it *EXP*-1 's really pretty hard for people from other countries to get in here even if they 're educated and will be a good asset to America . E_S

113936:19	And , um , you know he , um , got a green card \[ is , \+ and is \] in good standing in America and China ,

113965:10	You know , did we really protect them ? E_S
113968:26	\[ that 's , \+ and I think 0 that 's \] pretty crazy , because I mean those students who *T*-1 were in America when that was happening *T*-2 are almost certainly going *-3 to be in trouble if they go back , E_S

114729:8	I think 0 that 's about my favorite . E_S
114738:10	and I know 0 there 's still a hundred things 0 I do n't know how *-1 to do *T*-2 on it *T*-3 . E_S
114738:47	and I know 0 there 's still a hundred things 0 I do n't know how *-1 to do *T*-2 on it *T*-3 . E_S
114742:19	But , uh , you know , you learn something every time 0 you use it *T*-1 . E_S
114745:70	On \[ \[ this , \+ this thing that I 'm , \] \+ this survey \] or whatever , you know , \[ this \+ \] 0 I volunteered for *T*-1 . E_S
114802:58	Actually , I 'm doing this \[ for somebody else \+ \[ but , \+ \] you know , for a friend of mine . \] E_S
114804:44	It 's a research type project on uh , voice activated electronics , you know . E_S
114826:21	Now \[ I do n't know , \+ I do n't know \] everything about it E_S
114826:37	Now \[ I do n't know , \+ I do n't know \] everything about it E_S
114842:13	Well , I probably do because I 've , N_S
114844:27	\[ And I , \+ and I \] think that I do n't . E_S
114849:9	you know . N_S
114852:10	so I probably do . E_S
114869:8	I probably went through Richardson , then . E_S
114871:8	You probably did . E_S
114901:13	Uh , I think 0 they just send Christmas letters on it . E_S
114906:37	mostly my one sister uses hers for her children . You know , children 's games . E_S
114915:13	I do n't know . E_S
114974:39	And , like , I do n't really like the , you know , six hundred page long Stephen King novels and all that . E_S
114980:35	\[ I , \+ I \] read one , like maybe once a year . E_S
114995:70	He wrote books that *T*-1 were , like , pretty short and pretty easy 0 * to read *T*-2 , you know , like written * at a third grade level or whatever . E_S
115033:47	and * really portrays him as a , kind of a crazy man , you know . E_S
115043:76	Well , just like \[ \[ s- , \+ some , \] \+ one \] quote that he had *T*-1 was that he thought 0 the America 's emblem was stupid because it was an eagle , E_S
115050:25	\[ you , \+ \] you know , like the \[ t- , t- , \+ \] grizzly and stuff like that . E_S
115073:55	and * even like * reading some new age things , things that I do n't quite believe in *T*-1 , E_S
115077:8	I think that , N_S
115121:17	But , uh , I think 0 once you 're set *-1 in your ways , you 're set *-2 in your ways . E_S
115136:53	you want *-1 to go ahead and tell me your favorite team , or who you think 0 *T*-2 will be doing well this year . E_S
115161:16	And see that 's probably \[ all , \+ all \] 0 I saw *T*-1 . E_S
115166:12	so , that seems *-1 to help . E_S
115172:30	and the Mailman or Karl Malone was , you know , pretty big thing E_S
115181:9	and , maybe now that that 's over \[ they 'll , \+ they 'll \] come out of it E_S
115199:8	they seem *-1 to be kind of not having a very good few seasons . E_S
115205:12	But , I think 0 Chicago will probably with the N B A again . E_S
115205:25	But , I think 0 Chicago will probably with the N B A again . E_S
115213:11	They 'll probably be pretty good . E_S
115225:11	It will certainly be different . E_S
115228:13	I do n't know , how close I 'll follow them *T*-1 , though . E_S
115243:31	Well , I really do , uh , you know , E_S
115257:28	and I have n't really even started *-1 thinking about basketball yet E_S
115292:26	Oh , I generically have , you know , millions of hobbies . E_S
115309:57	Uh , \[ do you have any , \+ do you do any \] handicraft type things , I think 0 *T*-1 was the question . E_S
115343:38	my only craft work is kind of like computers and , you know , * go off to the little computer club meetings , E_S
115346:28	but \[ \[ I , \+ you know , I , \] \+ I 've \] got a couple of articles published *-1 . E_S
115354:13	I did n't know 0 there were such things . E_S
115358:76	They just get around \[ and , \+ and \] talk techy \[ or , \+ or \] else , uh , uh , you know , N_S
115370:30	Oh , \[ \[ I , \+ I think 0 I 'm , \] \+ I think 0 I 'm \] a hacker , E_S
115370:54	Oh , \[ \[ I , \+ I think 0 I 'm , \] \+ I think 0 I 'm \] a hacker , E_S
115371:76	but I 'm \[ \[ not , \+ not kind , \] \+ not \[ the , \+ uh , the , \] \] you know , * dial around randomly *-1 trying *-2 to break into computers type hackers , E_S
115394:18	I just , you know donate a whole bunch of my time to the Boy Scouts and have fun . E_S
115410:43	that 's a great thing 0 * to do *T*-1 , you know , really . E_S
115443:18	* Trying *-1 to think of the name of it . E_S
115458:7	but maybe next year . E_S
115461:14	I 've always thought 0 that would be a real fun thing 0 * to do *T*-1 . E_S
115470:28	like \[ you , you \+ \] know , for a vacation you 'd go *-1 backpacking ? E_S
115486:25	It 's better than , you know , * owning on them and making payments on them , and , you know , things like that . E_S
115486:70	It 's better than , you know , * owning on them and making payments on them , and , you know , things like that . E_S
115490:11	Sometimes I think 0 that might not be a bad idea . E_S
115490:21	Sometimes I think 0 that might not be a bad idea . E_S
115495:25	Uh , do you ever , you know , just vacation someplace where you strictly backpack *T*-1 ? E_S
115499:25	Uh , not recently because , you know , like the Boy Scouts makes it so that I go like once a month , you know . Someplace . E_S
115499:77	Uh , not recently because , you know , like the Boy Scouts makes it so that I go like once a month , you know . Someplace . E_S
115504:15	So , you know , they have lots of tours where they get a bunch of people together *T*-2 and off you go *T*-1 *T*-2 . E_S
115508:12	Which *T*-3 seems kind of reasonable because that means 0 you do n't have *-1 to take twenty thirteen year olds with you , which *T*-2 seems \[ \[ a , \+ a , \] \+ just a \] tad more relaxing . E_S
115508:84	Which *T*-3 seems kind of reasonable because that means 0 you do n't have *-1 to take twenty thirteen year olds with you , which *T*-2 seems \[ \[ a , \+ a , \] \+ just a \] tad more relaxing . E_S
115511:4	probably , N_S
115512:4	probably . N_S
115576:16	I just do n't know if I 'd have the time 0 * to use it *T*-1 . E_S
115579:18	guy just , you know , N_S
115587:13	I do n't know , E_S
115589:55	I had bought it *-1 used *-2 and kept it , , uh , I do n't know , ten years and got within , uh , three hundred dollars \[ of what , \+ *ICH*-5 when I sold it *T*-3 , of what \] I 'd paid *T*-4 for it and had it all those years , you know . E_S

115597:14	So , you know , you could n't complain about that . E_S
115635:14	I 've always thought , I bet 0 that would be more fun . E_S
115646:34	well , \[ I , \+ I 've \] always thought 0 I 'd like *-1 to *?* . E_S
115647:67	I 've never wanted *-1 to *?* bad enough * to make any effort * to do it , you know . E_S
115664:47	so \[ we \+ we \] get out on the water occasionally , you know . E_S
115675:38	and I 'd get the boat out on the , you know , Saturday , E_S
115679:72	and , I 'd say , well , I 'm going *-1 to leave the boat out , because , uh , we 'll probably do this again tomorrow . E_S
115702:11	It 's probably the prettiest lake in the state of Texas . E_S
115758:13	Oh , I think 0 you 'll like it better , E_S
115773:8	I know . E_S
115838:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 there are some areas \[ where we , \+ where we , \] uh , pretty well , you know , get our money 's worth *T*-1 , E_S

115841:28	but \[ I , \+ I \] also think 0 there are a lot of areas especially in , uh , \[ big government , \+ federal government , \] uh , where we 're short changed *-1 *T*-2 . Uh , lot of money spent * for , uh , things that *T*-3 are not used *-4 E_S
115845:21	\[ and , \+ you know , and \] , N_S
115857:27	And it *EXP*-1 's nice * to know 0 something does n't work or something does n't exist , E_S
115861:25	and \[ I , \+ I \] think that , uh , it *ICH*-1 's \[ a , \+ a \] tone of our times that politicians , uh , are into themselves more than they are into , you know , *-2 doing something worthwhile for the people 0 they represent *T*-3 , which *T*-4 is really unfortunate . E_S

115867:20	and I read , you know , how our politicians voted *T*-1 each week in the paper . E_S
115871:28	And \[ it 's , \+ you know , it *EXP*-1 's \] interesting how the votes vary *T*-2 E_S

115878:48	and , uh , you know , unless they 're in the limelight and under pressure . E_S
115880:8	I think 0 we get short changed *-1 on that . E_S
115892:14	What do you think *T*-1 about Robin Hood ? E_S
115896:39	Uh , there has *-1 to be some way , I think , 0 * to equalize education opportunities *T*-2 . E_S
115897:19	But , uh , you know , \[ \[ \[ our , \+ we , \] \+ we \] tend *-1 to think , \+ I think , 0 \[ e- , \+ especially \] big government , tends *-2 to think \] that the solution to everything is * to throw money at it . E_S

115921:79	As a matter of fact , I just paid my Richardson taxes because I live in Richardson and supplemented the Robin Hoods very thoroughly , I think . E_S
115924:9	I think 0 \[ we 've , uh , \+ Yeah , we have \] got it on the line , do n't we . E_S
115932:25	\[ D- , \+ \] you know , I mean , it 's going up and up and up . E_S

115943:26	But , \[ this , \+ you know , this , \] uh , N_S
115944:8	I think 0 *-1 living in Richardson , we 're kind of spoiled because I think 0 \[ we get , \+ we come closer to *-2 getting \] our money 's worth as far as the city is concerned , I think than probably \[ any , \+ any \] city in the country . E_S
115944:51	I think 0 *-1 living in Richardson , we 're kind of spoiled because I think 0 \[ we get , \+ we come closer to *-2 getting \] our money 's worth as far as the city is concerned , I think than probably \[ any , \+ any \] city in the country . E_S

115953:10	You know , \[ how can you , \+ how can you \] justify * raising anybody 's salary \[ if you , \+ you know , if you \] have *-1 to lay people off *T*-2 ? E_S
115953:86	You know , \[ how can you , \+ how can you \] justify * raising anybody 's salary \[ if you , \+ you know , if you \] have *-1 to lay people off *T*-2 ? E_S
115956:14	But , you know , I 'm not going *-1 to complain because Plano \[ got , \+ we all got \] a pay raise this year . E_S
115966:18	Well , yeah , I think 0 the teachers \[ d- , \+ uh , did , \] E_S
115967:15	and I do n't know about administrators . E_S
115970:24	so \[ I , \+ you know , I \] do n't get a raise anymore . E_S
115971:71	\[ \[ I just , \+ I , \] \+ I \] work part-time and just get , uh , , you know , N_S
115990:26	Well , it 's interesting , you know , because when you look at what Richardson has done *T*-1 with the early retirement *T*-2 you , N_S
116107:10	so I think , 0 I would like *-1 to go to Arizona . E_S
116113:54	It was the coldest 0 it 's been *T*-1 there ever in January , E_S I think 0 *T*-2 .
116130:13	But I 'm thinking of *-1 going back to work . E_S
116136:10	So you know a lot of good vacation spots ,
116139:24	\[ I lo- , \+ I know \] a lot of good places 0 * to go *T*-1 . E_S
116208:10	Do you know ? E_S

116237:8	I think 0 it 's a wonderful product . E_S
116281:8	you probably ski very well in Utah . E_S
116302:8	I know some people that *T*-1 went to B Y U . E_S
116348:8	You think , E_S
116351:8	I know . E_S
116353:17	So just , you know , N_S
116381:13	so you should think about *-1 doing something like that . E_S
116409:32	so when I heard the topic *T*-1 I was thinking of the thing down at , uh , Maceo High School in Dallas . E_S
116420:21	It is *?* , you know , E_S
116435:36	and it *EXP*-1 is really frightening , uh , * to think that you ca n't even send them to school in safety . E_S
116436:15	I mean , certainly , you know , you ca n't just turn them loose in the middle of Dallas , E_S
116436:25	I mean , certainly , you know , you ca n't just turn them loose in the middle of Dallas , E_S
116437:14	but , you know , when you ca n't even , send them on their normal activities in safety *T*-1 , \[ it , \+ it 's \] really frightening . E_S
116441:27	And , uh , I really , you know , N_S
116443:18	but I really do n't know what they can do *T*-1 . E_S
116445:33	and \[ I , \+ I \] really do n't know \[ what , \+ what \] *T*-1 can be done *-2 . E_S
116452:40	Uh , I mean , to me , in Plano you would think 0 that would be \[ about , \+ you know , about \] as innocent as you could get *?* \[ for \+ , for \] * being in \[ a , \+ a \] large area . E_S
116452:73	Uh , I mean , to me , in Plano you would think 0 that would be \[ about , \+ you know , about \] as innocent as you could get *?* \[ for \+ , for \] * being in \[ a , \+ a \] large area . E_S
116453:14	But , you know , my son comes home and tells me that , you know , he hears kids talk about *-1 having guns E_S
116453:49	But , you know , my son comes home and tells me that , you know , he hears kids talk about *-1 having guns E_S
116459:14	and , you know , they called the police E_S
116461:19	but my goodness , you know , \[ it , \+ it \] could have *?* easily . E_S
116463:10	Well , maybe that 's the answer to crime is * getting more prosecution . E_S
116467:10	You know , because I do n't , N_S
116468:86	now \[ I , \+ somehow I \] feel 0 we 're living in an impartial society as far as people seeing something happen , you know , across the street , or seeing someone get mugged *-1 , or unfortunately , raped *-1 , E_S
116482:10	You know , I mean they heard someone calling for help . E_S
116483:36	Nobody even called the police *-1 to say , you know , I hear a strange screaming E_S
116487:24	I 'm afraid 0 , you know , if you , N_S
116491:26	well , I can see , you know , especially if you heard screams from a house or something , * not going over there maybe , because , you know , it could be dangerous , E_S
116491:79	well , I can see , you know , especially if you heard screams from a house or something , * not going over there maybe , because , you know , it could be dangerous , E_S
116491:94	well , I can see , you know , especially if you heard screams from a house or something , * not going over there maybe , because , you know , it could be dangerous , E_S
116492:7	but certainly I ca n't understand * not calling the police . E_S
116498:18	I just , you know , N_S
116500:7	and probably one of the best things 0 we could do *T*-1 for crime is *-2 to participate ourselves in its prevention . E_S
116503:26	Well \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 you 're right there . E_S
116505:10	but I think 0 that 's real dangerous E_S
116506:22	and , uh , I do n't know . E_S
116507:86	I try *-1 to tell my kids \[ just , \+ *-3 just \] kind of be aware of what *T*-2 's around them , you know E_S
116515:15	well , you know , the call for help is what *T*-1 scares me now because \[ it , \+ it just , \] N_S
116516:13	I do n't know , E_S
116518:13	I do n't know , E_S
116523:55	But it 's that * not getting involved *RNR*-2 , that impersonal *RNR*-2 society , 0 I think 0 we live in *T*-1 today . E_S
116525:10	Well , maybe this thing \[ with \+ , with \] the child at school , maybe that will make people think a bit more and , you know , take some steps *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] correct it . E_S
116525:51	Well , maybe this thing \[ with \+ , with \] the child at school , maybe that will make people think a bit more and , you know , take some steps *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] correct it . E_S
116525:68	Well , maybe this thing \[ with \+ , with \] the child at school , maybe that will make people think a bit more and , you know , take some steps *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] correct it . E_S

116526:13	I do n't know , E_S
116537:13	I do n't know . E_S
116538:23	I mean , I do n't know the details . E_S
116540:47	It was someone that , *T*-1 uh , \[ show- , \+ you know , just kind of showed \] up at the field . E_S
116571:49	Well , did you understand \[ what this was for *T*-2 , \+ you know , what it was for *T*-1 , \] what we , N_S
116601:118	Well , I do n't really watch too many T V shows other than , uh , occasionally \[ I 'll , \+ I 'll \] turn on DONAHUE because it comes on in the morning when I seem *-1 to be getting ready around here *T*-2 . E_S
116605:71	\[ And , \+ uh , so \] \[ if , \+ if \] there 's no one else around , you know , it 's just me and I have a chance * to listen to something , I 'll turn that on ,
116606:50	but , uh , just \[ for the , \+ for the \] conversation factor , I think *T*-1 , E_S
116607:27	\[ but , \+ and then \] I think 0 I enjoy when I catch it *T*-1 , I do n't even know what night it 's on *T*-2 , but DESIGNING WOMEN sometimes , E_S
116607:72	\[ but , \+ and then \] I think 0 I enjoy when I catch it *T*-1 , I do n't even know what night it 's on *T*-2 , but DESIGNING WOMEN sometimes , E_S
116619:103	And then there 's a new one that *T*-2 started out that I 've caught *T*-1 \[ occa- , \+ a couple of times \] called * GOOD AND EVIL , I think . E_S
116640:29	\[ It 's , \+ uh , I think 0 it 's \] on like Tuesday nights from ten to eleven E_S
116661:21	Uh , I do n't even know , *-1 to tell you the truth . E_S
116682:32	and now when I watch them *T*-1 , I think , why did I ever watch those *T*-2 ? E_S
116697:12	So do you know of any other shows in the even , or something that you enjoy *T*-1 ? E_S
116725:13	well , I think , N_S
116741:27	* Watch the weather channel so that we know what the weather 's going *-1 to be like *T*-2 . E_S
116755:18	well , I do n't know if we 've talked our full three minutes or not . E_S
116757:13	I do n't know , E_S
116780:36	so it kind of makes it *EXP*-1 easy , you know , * to do a little something for it . E_S
116783:65	because \[ we , \+ uh , we 've \] talked to a lot of people from Texas , it seems 0 *T*-1 , E_S
116784:10	and we thought , well , maybe they work \[ from , \+ for \] Dallas , N_S
116784:21	and we thought , well , maybe they work \[ from , \+ for \] Dallas , N_S
116804:8	I think 0 it 's pretty much typical for this area . E_S
116860:63	and \[ the garages were always , \+ if the house \[ w- , \+ was \] large , it seemed like the garages were \] small even if they were three car garages which *T*-1 is what we have *T*-2 . E_S
116886:101	but my husband 's got a big space in between \[ the , \+ where the \] cars are *T*-1 and the house , where he has a big work shop , you know , workbench and everything *T*-2 . E_S
116906:14	Because , you know , they have a lot of things of their own , E_S
116907:24	and \[ I , \+ you know , I \] would n't mind *-1 having , N_S
116913:13	I do n't know , E_S
116918:41	So I did n't end up with my vacant room like I had thought 0 I would *?* . E_S
116930:13	and so it seems like it 's always used *-1 as a bedroom . E_S
116937:17	but , I do n't know , E_S
116938:94	I just still have need for the four bedrooms *-1 just having company from time to time . And some of them coming back home and things , you know . E_S
116955:8	you sure do n't . E_S
116956:21	At times I keep *-1 thinking , though , 0 that might be kind of nice . E_S
116956:38	At times I keep *-1 thinking , though , 0 that might be kind of nice . E_S
117007:8	they know everything . E_S
117026:8	I think that once you do that , your children kind of develop the same attitudes . E_S
117031:16	I do n't really think 0 anything 's been broken *-1 . E_S
117032:68	Every now and then we have *-1 to kind of go and say , now * do n't bother this , you know . E_S
117048:18	And , uh , * seems like all big cities have plenty of that nowadays , does n't it *?* ? E_S
117052:4	sure . E_S
117053:28	Uh , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 it 's N_S
117055:11	I always thought of Dallas as *-1 being a fairly safe place . E_S
117058:33	but our crimes up here , uh , as I think 0 it must be *?* in most cities now , E_S
117060:20	and they said 0 they thought 0 \[ a lot of it , \+ \] the reason 0 it was up so *T*-1 was because \[ of the , \+ \] uh , so many people are without work nowadays , E_S
117063:13	Do you really believe that ? E_S
117074:13	I do n't know if I believe that or not , E_S
117074:24	I do n't know if I believe that or not , E_S
117075:30	but , \[ it , \+ it \] does seem up E_S
117084:32	Well , \[ we got a , \+ I think 0 we got a \] pretty good newspaper . E_S
117089:10	MORNING NEWS seems *T*-1 to have the largest circulation . E_S
117090:8	I think 0 it 's a pretty good , N_S
117095:26	The HERALD is owned *-1 , I think 0 *T*-2 , by the TIMES out of , uh , L A , or somewhere . E_S
117107:40	uh , E_S they do n't play it up , I do n't think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
117108:54	Uh , but \[ there , \+ there \] is too much of it , you know , uh too many homes broken into * . E_S
117127:13	I did n't think 0 ours ever would be \[ burgled into , \+ burgled *-1 , \] E_S
117143:22	but since that happened , I certainly have *?* . E_S
117149:73	Uh , , with \[ the , \+ uh , all the \] doors and the , uh , infrared \[ thing , \+ you know , motion detector . \] E_S
117169:43	Well , is that a necessary feature * to have somebody , you know , at the other end of the line E_S
117172:8	I think , uh , 0 the thing that *T*-1 makes a lot of noise \[ would , \+ would \] suffice . E_S
117177:49	But , uh , this deal *ICH*-1 that was part of it for , you know , three years or so * to pay the unit off or whatever . E_S
117186:42	because , uh , uh , we 've goofed it up , you know , E_S
117187:22	several times you 'll hit the wrong key , not intentionally or something E_S
117189:38	so \[ I guess 0 it 's , \+ you know , I think 0 it 's \] all right . E_S
117189:46	so \[ I guess 0 it 's , \+ you know , I think 0 it 's \] all right . E_S
117191:30	* to answer your question , \[ I think , \+ uh uh , I think , \] uh , 0 that is a pretty good deterrent in itself , E_S

117208:12	Who *T*-1 knows , you know . E_S

117210:15	And \[ I think 0 they 're probably , \+ I think 0 it probably \] does these things \[ or \+ \] \[ sur- , \+ supposedly \] pretty good . E_S

117214:33	Boy , they sure advertise \[ them , you know , \+ so many of them \] nowadays . E_S
117224:16	Down here , we seem *-1 to , N_S
117226:12	but the statistics seem *-1 to say that . E_S
117227:13	I do n't know . E_S
117229:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 it 's the murder capital of the country now . E_S
117235:15	I would gather probably from drugs . E_S
117239:10	And I think 0 that 's the reason 0 it 's so high everywhere *T*-1 . E_S
117243:17	But , I do n't think 0 there 's anyplace , N_S
117245:16	years ago , you thought , well , these little small cities and all , would n't have that problem , E_S
117250:71	We 've had relatives that *T*-1 their children were just as involved in it , uh , as anyone , you know . E_S
117255:13	I do n't know , E_S
117256:13	I do n't know what the solution is *T*-1 . E_S
117259:45	And all these politicians \[ make , \+ make \] hay over , you know *-1 being anticrime , E_S
117263:15	but they have n't seemed *-1 to have changed anything . E_S
117269:10	and nothing seems *-1 to change . E_S
117270:22	And , uh , I 'm not sure that anything will *?* because \[ these , \+ if something could happen *-1 to make these \] people not want *-2 to buy it N_S
117281:26	So , \[ \[ I do n't know , \+ I do n't got , \] \+ you know , I do n't know \] what the solution is *T*-1 , E_S
117281:59	So , \[ \[ I do n't know , \+ I do n't got , \] \+ you know , I do n't know \] what the solution is *T*-1 , E_S
117281:72	So , \[ \[ I do n't know , \+ I do n't got , \] \+ you know , I do n't know \] what the solution is *T*-1 , E_S
117286:13	I do n't think 0 anyone does , in fact . E_S
117292:27	well , *-1 just to let you know , I have , uh , two , uh , children of my own . E_S
117315:10	You know , they 're not very old , E_S
117329:14	but , you know , the weather 's trying *-1 to turn now E_S
117344:8	You know what I meant *T*-1 with rain , huh . E_S
117386:63	Uh , so that was the thing that \[ I , \+ I \] noticed *T*-1 that , I know 0 a \[ lot of people , \+ lot of friends \] that \[ we have *T*-2 , \+ they have \] a tendency * to do the same thing . E_S
117401:31	In fact , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 things \[ were , \+ were \] quite a bit different . E_S
117405:73	Uh , when \[ my , \+ my \] big kids \[ were , \+ were \] little *T*-1 , uh , you know , \[ \[ ev- , \+ ev- , \] \+ all \] the mothers were home . E_S
117409:10	You know , \[ the , \+ the \] kids got up in the morning and ate breakfast and poked around E_S
117410:58	and then when they felt like it *T*-1 , they went out *-2 to play , you know when they \[ were , \+ were \] little like that *T*-3 . E_S
117417:32	And , uh , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 it 's gotten , uh , very different . E_S
117423:17	or uh , you know , you got some cartoons E_S
117429:70	\[ They 'd rather , \+ I mean , they 'd \] take their trucks out in the backyard , you know go out and play and stuff . E_S
117433:40	But , we always did , uh , oh , just , you know , to the park for walks and to the zoo and museum . E_S
117442:26	\[ and , \+ and \] you know , so whatever , you know , they would do *T*-1 , we 'd go along with *T*-2 E_S
117442:44	\[ and , \+ and \] you know , so whatever , you know , they would do *T*-1 , we 'd go along with *T*-2 E_S
117459:29	kind of the same thing , our , you know , N_S

117479:52	we go down there fairly often , you know , for a weekend for , you know , family get-togethers and stuff like that . E_S
117486:8	I know 0 \[ we 'd , \+ I 'd \] like *-1 to get into *-2 do more camping and outings and things . E_S
117487:10	And I think 0 we probably will *?* soon as the boys get a little bit older . E_S
117487:20	And I think 0 we probably will *?* soon as the boys get a little bit older . E_S
117491:19	But , uh , you know , for right now , they do n't , you know , N_S
117491:49	But , uh , you know , for right now , they do n't , you know , N_S
117499:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think , 0 our kids just always dearly loved that , you know , play * bounce the ball , or just , uh , N_S
117499:60	\[ I , \+ I \] think , 0 our kids just always dearly loved that , you know , play * bounce the ball , or just , uh , N_S
117503:52	course , when our big ones were little *T*-1 , we lived up north , you know E_S
117507:98	and this time of the year \[ \[ it , \+ it , \] \+ the \] fun thing was * to go out and swoosh around in the leaves , you know . E_S
117511:21	\[ So , \+ You know , so \] \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] very different E_S
117516:33	\[ and , \+ and , \] uh , you know , \[ we also , \+ * come winter time we 'd \] stick them on sleds . E_S
117521:38	\[ and , \+ and \] from little on , you know , N_S
117526:10	You know , when our kids were little *T*-1 \[ you , \+ you \] got them a pair of skates . E_S
117544:8	you know , how , sometimes when you marry someone *T*-1 that you get along on everything except one major thing . E_S
117554:50	but to me , he belongs up \[ \[ in the field , \+ you know , in the ranch , \] \+ in the farm \] E_S
117575:10	You know , course , when he runs around the yard *T*-1 , he just digs , E_S
117576:13	he does n't know that he 's tearing up things , E_S
117586:15	and I did not know what * to expect *T*-1 from a dog *-2 having not had one , E_S
117598:54	and \[ I , \+ well , I \] wish 0 you had told me you know , E_S
117608:43	And I told my husband *RNR*-1 , E_S I said *RNR*-1 , you know , it 's either me or the dog , E_S
117609:35	and he looked at me like , well , you know N_S
117618:8	I thought , oh , boy , do I have a pet . E_S
117652:48	\[ But , \+ and \] she just sat there on my lap , you know . E_S
117671:10	You know , and she just liked his shoes E_S

117694:15	She must have known 0 he did n't like her or something . E_S
117795:78	and he 's just huddled *-1 up like , if you 'll be nice to me , I wo n't make any trouble , you know . E_S
117817:8	I think 0 they 're cutting us off . E_S
117835:15	and I do n't know why , -body 's calling *T*-1 . E_S
117840:8	I think 0 they would cut us off , E_S
117853:38	Well , it 's somebody calling for my kids , you know , E_S
117857:8	I know . E_S
117860:8	I know 0 it is *?* . E_S
117903:42	\[ a- , \+ although \] I 'll tell you , you know ,
117914:58	One of my first cars was a fifty-six Buick . Which , after awhile I could , you know , take \[ *T*-2 it \+ \] apart in my sleep if I needed *-1 to *?* . E_S
117923:25	and , now since then , you know , the closer 0 a car is *T*-1 to a fifty-six Buick , \[ the , \+ the \] more I know *T*-2 about it . E_S

117948:50	And , uh , now brakes , I 've always done a lot of , you know , * changing brakes . E_S
117952:60	And \[ I used *-1 to do , \+ I could always do \] the alternator , you know , and starter . E_S
117980:9	It probably slipped *-1 loose , did n't it ? E_S
117983:81	\[ \[ I , \+ I did a lot of things that I , \] \+ I did everything that I \] could think *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S
118008:59	and \[ altog- , \+ all total , \] it *EXP*-2 was just under two hundred dollars , * believe it or not , * to get all that done *-1 . E_S
118011:54	well , it really was n't quite , \[ s- , \+ as \] bad as you thought , \[ was it , \+ was it *?* ? \] E_S
118014:28	actually , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 it was a lot of money , E_S
118023:33	it got to the point where I did n't know what *T*-1 was going on *T*-2 E_S
118049:84	For sixteen bucks \[ they 'll \+ not only will \] they change the oil in ten minutes , and do \[ a f- , \+ you know , as good a \] job as I can do *?* , but they 'll , uh , lube , too . E_S
118060:59	\[ And , \+ but \] one of the main reasons was the disposal of the oil , you know . E_S
118075:19	they raise ours it seems like *T*-1 constantly . E_S
118084:22	But , uh , at least we thought 0 we 'd get something back from that . E_S
118090:13	Well , it seems like a big politics game E_S
118129:37	\[ and , \+ and \] I feel like , you know , N_S
118136:22	but , uh , I do n't think 0 the rich are paying \[ \[ mo- , \+ less , \] \+ not enough , \] E_S
118137:8	I think 0 they 're paying too much . E_S
118139:8	You think 0 the rich are paying too much ? E_S
118145:18	Well , I do n't know many rich that *T*-1 do n't have enough tax breaks * to , N_S
118154:33	Now I 'll go along with that . You know , E_S
118163:13	Now , I think 0 that would be fair . E_S
118167:17	And I , you know , N_S
118168:39	\[ no , \+ no \] ifs , ands and buts , you know , E_S
118169:44	no big elaborate laws that *T*-1 \[ say , \+ uh , you know , call \] for a lot of enforcement or a lot of review . E_S
118170:21	It 's just , you know , you make this , you pay ten percent . E_S
118176:8	I think 0 it 's pretty fair . E_S
118194:17	so now , you know , when you sign your \[ W-Four form or whatever , \+ W-Two whatever \] that is *T*-1 *T*-2 , then they always say , do you want a extra amount for state . Which *T*-3 is ridiculous , E_S
118200:29	but it 's been that way for the last probably ten years . E_S
118212:14	But , you know , if you have a lot of federal deduction , it ends up *-1 hurting you state wise . E_S
118216:30	And you end up *-1 owing , you know , E_S
118217:8	you may get nine hundred dollars back from federal E_S
118223:32	But , \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know . E_S
118236:18	Well , what I believe 0 *T*-1 is one of the major \[ pro- , \+ uh , things \] that *T*-2 is wrong with our public school system is that , um , we do not have enough discipline E_S
118236:76	Well , what I believe 0 *T*-1 is one of the major \[ pro- , \+ uh , things \] that *T*-2 is wrong with our public school system is that , um , we do not have enough discipline E_S
118248:35	Uh , when I went to school *T*-1 , I know 0 *T*-3 I was scared to death about *-4 being disciplined *-2 , E_S
118259:10	You know , \[ \[ you just , \+ you did not see , \] \+ I did not see \] anybody in my classrooms , when I was going to school *T*-1 , act up the way that kids do these days in the classroom *T*-2 . E_S
118298:8	I know . E_S
118300:66	But the school system 's afraid of *-1 getting sued *-2 and , um , all sorts of lawsuits I 'm sure 0 *T*-3 because of things like that . E_S
118308:15	And , I also believe \[ we do n't , \+ \] even though I feel like I pay a good share towards the school system , that the teachers are still underpaid E_S
118317:17	And , um , I think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more , that maybe that could solve some of our problems . E_S
118317:66	And , um , I think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more , that maybe that could solve some of our problems . E_S
118326:12	and you know , we 'll just have *-1 to wait and see whether that 's approved *-2 or not . E_S
118332:10	You know , I do n't know your feelings toward that . E_S
118332:23	You know , I do n't know your feelings toward that . E_S
118337:8	I think in some ways that *T*-1 they need *-2 to be more careful of the teachers that they hire *T*-3 . E_S
118341:44	I have heard stories *ICH*-2 , uh , from other parents that I know of *T*-1 , their children are in high school that teachers are out there *-3 giving drugs and selling drugs , E_S
118357:14	and , you know , to \[ be , \+ be \] more careful of the teachers that we place *T*-1 in our school . N_S
118361:34	Um , that 's basically about all that I know that *T*-1 may be wrong with the school system . E_S
118361:44	Um , that 's basically about all that I know that *T*-1 may be wrong with the school system . E_S
118361:50	Um , that 's basically about all that I know that *T*-1 may be wrong with the school system . E_S
118364:13	\[ I think , \+ with what they have *-1 to work with *T*-2 , I think \] 0 *T*-3 they 're doing a pretty good job right now . E_S
118364:56	\[ I think , \+ with what they have *-1 to work with *T*-2 , I think \] 0 *T*-3 they 're doing a pretty good job right now . E_S
118367:8	I think 0 they 're doing real good job . E_S
118372:23	But , then , what do I know *T*-1 , E_S
118384:13	so this is probably a real hard subject for you . E_S
118428:8	I think 0 five minutes is the max . E_S
118433:10	do you know ? E_S
118435:18	Oh , I do n't know . E_S
118444:13	well , I think 0 at this point , I for one am worried about every aspect . E_S
118447:49	especially , uh , you , since you 're in the same metroplex , E_S you know ,
118450:8	I think 0 the drive by shootings are getting *-1 to be so common , 0 that 's really \[ a , \+ \] something 0 you got *-2 to protect yourself from *T*-3 . E_S
118456:8	I know . E_S
118468:21	I just heard , you know , 0 last week at that one school , they started *-1 putting them in because there was that one shooting E_S
118474:58	Well , we had a vice principal shot at here last year \[ on the , \+ you know , on the \] school grounds after school . E_S
118479:13	so you know , these kids do n't have any trouble *-1 getting a hold of guns \[ in any \+ in any \] neighborhood , * does n't seem like *T*-3 . E_S

118492:30	it *EXP*-1 's kind of scary * to think , 0 you send your child to school E_S
118496:8	I know . E_S
118500:8	I know , E_S
118502:30	it 's been out of hand , I think 0 *T*-1 , for a while , E_S

118511:8	I think 0 it goes all the way back to the break up of the family to a certain extent E_S
118511:56	I think 0 it goes all the way back to the break up of the family to a certain extent E_S
118521:8	I think 0 that 's where it stems from *T*-1 , is that
118522:19	and , um , you know , you 've got \[ a lot of , \+ a lot more \] women that *T*-2 are working nowadays that *T*-3 are n't home with the children E_S
118530:10	and that may impact it as well . E_S
118532:8	I think so , E_S
118533:70	\[ and , \+ and \] then there 's a drop in , uh , the training of morals , really , you know . E_S

118582:13	Oh , I know , E_S
118584:21	it 's just , you know , another killing . E_S

118617:26	oh duh , duh , duh you know , E_S
118622:8	I know ,

118681:8	I know , E_S
118683:10	You know , he was just begging her on the phone , E_S
118688:25	And there are times 0 I think , gee , I MUMBLEx should give my kids gu- , N_S
118690:23	Well , what *ICH*-2 do you know *T*-1 about Latin American policies ? E_S
118692:13	Well , I think 0 they 're kind of ambivalent , really . E_S

119139:5	maybe I can learn something . E_S
119141:18	Well , I do n't know how much you can learn *T*-1 . E_S
119144:15	I 'm not so sure 0 I 'm good at it , E_S
119152:28	Of course , I do n't , you know , N_S
119153:8	I think 0 when they refer to different kinds of fishing *T*-1 N_S

119163:30	That 's about the only kind 0 I know how * to do *T*-1 *T*-2 . E_S
119195:27	Uh , there 's a lake like maybe two or three miles from here , E_S
119196:59	and it 's very convenient on afternoons when I want *-1 to just get away and sit and think *T*-2 . E_S
119218:8	I think 0 the lakes are probably different *ICH*-1 in Michigan than they are in Texas . E_S
119218:23	I think 0 the lakes are probably different *ICH*-1 in Michigan than they are in Texas . E_S
119223:84	but unless you have a boat you ca n't really get into \[ the , \+ where they call the \] good fishing holes *T*-1 , you know . E_S
119237:37	I catch a lot of little old , uh , I think 0 they call them *RNR*-1 perch E_S
119245:53	So \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] so close to the dock that I think 0 all 0 I do *T*-1 is feed them a little bit E_S

119278:11	so I seem them swimming by every once in a while . E_S
119281:8	I think 0 I 'd be a little bit afraid of those . E_S
119284:49	\[ \[ they can , \+ they 're , \] \+ they 're \] certainly ugly . E_S

119306:8	I think that , uh , probably around here people fish for bass and crappie and catfish more than anything else . E_S
119306:22	I think that , uh , probably around here people fish for bass and crappie and catfish more than anything else . E_S

119567:193	but \[ I , \+ again , I \] do n't want *-1 to see us pour \[ a whole lot of economic aid into the Soviet Union without a , \+ uh , well , uh , a whole lot under any circumstances \] because \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know , E_S \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] a believer in the old adage that if somebody earns something it 's worth more *ICH*-2 to them than if you give it to them , E_S
119573:13	that does n't seem *-1 to cost a whole lot of money . E_S
119581:15	so they do n't seem *-1 to have a clue . E_S
119587:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 Bush 's kind of followed suit . E_S
119590:15	Uh , you know , and then there 's the homeless issue , E_S
119591:86	and there really is a lot 0 we could be doing *T*-1 stateside without , uh , *-2 hurting our international aspects or straining any international relations I think 0 *T*-3 , E_S
119595:28	\[ \[ I just , \+ I think 0 we got , \] \+ once we \] started economic aid overseas we have really set ourselves up *-1 to be sort of \[ the , \+ the \] world bank , \[ and \+ \] as far as aid is concerned *-2 , E_S
119599:10	and I think 0 there 's a limit , E_S
119614:8	I know it . E_S
119616:28	\[ I just , \+ I do n't know . \] E_S
119617:8	I think 0 it 's definitely time for a change , E_S
119620:37	\[ this \+ it *EXP*-2 \] \[ s- , \+ seems \] *-1 to be 0 we 're turning into a black and white society , E_S
119633:13	Well , I think , uh , 0 it would n't hurt , E_S
119634:10	and I know 0 the Independent Party 's been trying for years *-1 to get \[ \[ a , \+ a , \] \+ a \] real force \[ \[ in , \+ in the , \] \+ uh , in Congress , \] E_S
119640:55	and if they would vote with their conscience and with what their constituents feel *T*-1 , I think , uh , 0 *T*-2 we might have \[ \[ a , \+ a lot better , \] \+ a lot more \] efficient running government and a lot better laws passed *-3 . E_S

119643:23	Well , of course , you know , we have the national embarrassment *ICH*-1 in our state , Jessie Helms , E_S
119647:14	of course it seems to me that every time 0 he opens his mouth *T*-1 , \[ he , \+ he \] just lines up people against him E_S
119657:24	he 's , very ineffective , I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
119676:28	but , uh , unfortunately for him , but maybe fortunately for us , his health is not great , E_S
119687:36	not as well as I would like *-1 to *?* probably E_S
119728:16	little , you know , about everything . N_S
119733:12	but you know , I like *-1 to know pretty well what *T*-2 's happening . E_S
119733:30	but you know , I like *-1 to know pretty well what *T*-2 's happening . E_S
119734:93	Political things do n't interest me a great deal , except I do like *-1 to stay informed enough *-2 to , feel like I halfway vote intelligently , you know E_S
119738:43	but , uh , other than that , uh , I just , you know , N_S
119740:30	* Stay in touch with it and \[ know , \+ feel like I know \] what *T*-2 's going on . E_S
119740:48	* Stay in touch with it and \[ know , \+ feel like I know \] what *T*-2 's going on . E_S
119784:22	and I 'm particularly interested in certain things *ICH*-1 of course , like all the news about Haiti recently because I 've been down there E_S
119801:21	I follow it , you know , E_S
119811:22	and , uh , I do n't know , E_S
119813:60	they 've just been so terribly mistreated *-1 for so \[ many , \+ many \] years , you know . I mean , through Papa Doc , E_S
119827:10	and I think 0 it 's been better since he died , E_S
119839:39	he did n't mind *-1 having people bumped *-2 off for certain things , you know . E_S
119839:51	he did n't mind *-1 having people bumped *-2 off for certain things , you know . E_S
119843:69	But , uh , It 's , one of the reasons 0 the U S \[ was n't so , \+ you know , did n't do \] more than they did *?* at the time *T*-1 because they were n't all that excited about him , although he 's probably better than a lot of them , E_S

119850:44	\[ but , \+ uh , but \] then again , who , you know , N_S
119855:16	so what do you think *T*-1 about the quality of news coverage in America ? E_S
119857:8	I think 0 it 's pretty darned good , E_S
119858:8	I think 0 we 're lucky *-1 to have as good a coverage as we have *?* E_S
119865:54	\[ but , \+ uh , but , \] that 's kind of understandable , because , you know , of course if you watch it \[ more , \+ more \] than once a day , I mean , it 's the same thing over and over and over and over , E_S
119873:60	but then again , so many people you got *-1 to understand only catch it once a day , maybe E_S
119877:10	but I think 0 the quality of \[ our , \+ uh , our \] news is just , uh ,
119878:13	I do n't believe 0 it could be better E_S
119885:15	well , you know , I think 0 \[ it probably could be , \+ it always could be \] better , E_S
119885:23	well , you know , I think 0 \[ it probably could be , \+ it always could be \] better , E_S
119885:38	well , you know , I think 0 \[ it probably could be , \+ it always could be \] better , E_S
119888:13	I do n't think so . E_S
119891:13	I do n't think 0 our news could be better . E_S
119902:13	well , I think that , um , N_S
119903:13	I do n't know . E_S
119905:26	Well , you always want *-1 to think 0 everything can be improved upon *-2 E_S
119915:8	I think that , E_S
119917:30	But by trial and error over the years , I think 0 *T*-2 *T*-3 they got it about as good as they 're going *-1 to get it . E_S
119919:13	Well , that may be so , E_S
119924:8	I think that I 'm not always satisfied with \[ how dig they deep into the \+ how deep they dig *T*-1 into \] things and such . E_S
119990:21	That 's right , you know . E_S
120026:22	and then , uh , you know , you can , N_S
120028:44	and I seen \[ a , \+ a \] magazine for , you know , N_S
120036:28	\[ and , \+ and , \] you know , basically , you know , \[ I , \+ what I \] did *T*-1 was , I redid the whole interior . E_S

120104:13	I do n't know . E_S
120111:64	I usually get them for Christmas gifts \[ or , \+ and \] like when people go , you know , \[ to , \+ on \] trips *T*-1 or something . E_S
120153:48	So I 'd like *-1 to go back , because we had , you know , N_S
120158:44	everything was like an hour or two hours at the Louvre , you know , things like that where you need the whole day *T*-1 , E_S
120173:11	I always thought 0 I would *?* , E_S
120174:14	but who *T*-1 knows now . E_S
120176:9	and , maybe some day . E_S
120181:14	what does he think *T*-1 of your , uh , T shirts and , N_S
120239:4	sure . E_S
120319:18	why , I do n't know *T*-1 , E_S
120320:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 they 're kind of nice 0 * to have *T*-1 , E_S

120324:13	I do n't know , E_S
120330:29	\[ What , \+ what \] do you think *T*-1 ? E_S
120357:20	and it just , you know , was almost cruel because , N_S
120393:27	and our neighbors were , I do n't know , kind of slimy , E_S
120420:21	I found it , you know , in the street . E_S
120428:64	Well , um , I have gone to girl 's camp a few times , as \[ a , \+ you know , a \] chaperon or a leader , whatever E_S
120446:47	we went fairly early in the season for this area , which *T*-1 is probably April is when we went *T*-2 , E_S
120461:68	Usually * try *-1 to have \[ a , \+ uh , occasionally a \] camp fire at night , you know , and roast the marshmallows and what all . E_S
120478:36	and , uh , he 'd always tell us , you know , okay , * look for , you know , a nice flat little area where we can pitch our tents *T*-1 , E_S

120488:26	and she 'd bring along , you know , something , because tradition had it 0 we would never catch anything , E_S
120506:10	you know , in the hills \[ we , \+ we \] would do like \[ you di- , \+ \[ you folks did , \+ you folks did , \] \] would take the nature hikes \[ and , \+ you know , and \] look for animals , E_S

120507:20	and we always , you know , N_S
120522:10	You know , hike up those mountains is just really fantastic . Um . E_S
120529:29	I 'm not acquainted with any , you know , E_S
120531:41	there 's woods and things out in East Texas Tyler area , you know , E_S
120538:13	I do n't know of any place in Texas that *T*-1 has , uh , really big , you know , what I call *T*-2 *RNR*-3 mountains . E_S

120554:33	They have , um , screened in areas , you know , E_S
120569:13	I do n't know if I can rate camping , E_S
120570:14	but , you know , it sure beats * driving a thousand miles , *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] find a mountain , I guess 0 *T*-2 . E_S
120570:23	but , you know , it sure beats * driving a thousand miles , *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] find a mountain , I guess 0 *T*-2 . E_S
120611:43	and \[ I , \+ I \] mow it , uh , you know , with a mulch mower so \[ the , \+ the \] particles fall down E_S
120674:15	And we did not know in August *-1 to put down the , uh , whatever it is *T*-2 for grub worms . E_S
120693:23	\[ you , \+ you \] think 0 that 's what it was *T*-1 , huh . E_S
120748:15	uh , you know , kind of slow , and , as you say , very expensive . E_S
120768:28	Uh , well , I put , you know N_S
120778:23	that was like September , I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
120782:33	And I had *-1 to water it , you know E_S
120790:18	out here , you know , we do n't have as many trees in Plano , E_S
120809:19	but , uh , you know , every once in a while we get one of these really cold deals E_S
120822:21	And I said , You know , you need *-1 to either read Neal Sperry 's book before you shop or get a reputable nursery , because lot of places \[ that *T*-2 would , \+ \] are just trying *-3 to sell whatever *ICH*-5 *T*-4 was pretty out there , E_S
120823:15	and we did n't know the difference . E_S
120824:43	And every year we learn one more thing *ICH*-2 that we did n't know *T*-1 before . Like about these mums . E_S
120869:62	and , uh , \[ our , \+ our \] garages come in \[ from the back , \+ you know , from the alley \] E_S
120901:113	Uh , sometimes when I hear \[ \[ what , \+ what \] they 're , \+ \[ even what , \+ even what \] the politicians are \] making *T*-1 *T*-2 , you know , when they 're getting a hundred and fifty thousand plus benefits and that *T*-3 , uh , I think 0 that 's just a bit too much 0 * to be paying them *T*-4 , uh , E_S

120904:18	that 's , I think 0 *T*-2 is just being thrown *-1 away . E_S
120908:56	And then when you read about that *T*-2 they 're spending all the money on , you know , these studies that *T*-1 have no relevance whatsoever ,
120925:10	and I think 0 there 's just \[ too many , \+ too many \] levels of bureaucracy . E_S
120926:8	I think 0 it \[ can be , \+ can be \] managed *-1 by \[ less , \+ uh , less \] levels . E_S
120930:13	Well , I know 0 any time 0 \[ there 's , \+ there 's \] a big , uh , budget cut *T*-1 , you know , E_S

120955:23	and you 're out , you know . E_S
120956:8	I think 0 we 're starting *-1 to see it a little bit now , E_S
120957:10	but I think , uh , 0 I do n't know \[ what , \+ what \] kind of input we 're going *-2 to get *T*-1 from the public and how they 're going *-3 to go about * doing it *T*-4 . E_S

120958:16	Because \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 we 're just getting taxed *-1 way too much . E_S
120958:27	Because \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 we 're just getting taxed *-1 way too much . E_S
120962:39	I mean , right now we 're getting taxed *-1 \[ probably , \+ probably \] around thirty-five percent , or more . E_S
120962:49	I mean , right now we 're getting taxed *-1 \[ probably , \+ probably \] around thirty-five percent , or more . E_S

120982:15	and I do n't know what our gas tax is *T*-1 . E_S
120983:8	I think 0 it 's somewhere around twenty five cents a gallon . E_S
120988:10	and they may not raise it , you know , federally as much one year , E_S
120988:28	and they may not raise it , you know , federally as much one year , E_S
120993:13	Well , I know 0 \[ they say \+ like with Reagan , they say \] no new taxes , E_S
120995:28	and that just raises your taxes , you know ,
121004:31	and all of a sudden , I do n't know , \[ it 's just , \+ it 's \] eating me *-1 alive . E_S
121014:130	Well , uh , even though it 's totally out of \[ my , \+ uh , my \] degree training , I 've been working \[ as , \+ as , \] in the horticultural aspect , so the last , I do n't know , fifteen , twenty years ,
121035:22	but , uh , I do n't know , E_S
121052:33	but I still take care of the , you know , flower beds and things like that . E_S
121055:99	I was even planning *-1 to go out and to , uh , dig up some hibiscus plants that *T*-2 will not make it through the winter here , but , you know , were planted *-3 in the ground since last spring E_S
121070:38	it 's a plant that we 've had *T*-1 for probably twenty-five years that these were cuttings off of *T*-2 , you know . E_S

121084:15	why , you know , everyone that *T*-1 lives in town and has yards practically has \[ land- , \+ \] uh , watering system . E_S
121088:46	And so with that , why , our lawns do stay , um , you know , pretty nice all summer , if you water . E_S
121101:27	\[ and , \+ and \] I just think 0 it 's ugly . E_S
121104:54	When I go back home to my parents in Illinois in the winter *T*-1 , you know , \[ and \+ \] their grass is fairly green . E_S

121119:20	Some people have , I think 0 it 's *RNR*-2 fescue that *T*-1 stays green all winter , E_S
121129:14	but , you know , they almost stick out like \[ a , \+ I guess not a \] sore thumb , a pretty thumb . E_S

121460:8	I think so . E_S
121496:31	If I was having a dinner party I would probably , um , have \[ \[ some , \+ um , some , \] \+ uh , um , some \] fruit 0 * to start with *T*-1 with some apples sliced * up and maybe some cheddar cheese and crackers and grapes and , um , probably serve maybe some wine and beer and maybe have some , uh , uh , salsa and chips *ICH*-2 around and peanuts .

121498:23	so . Um , I would have maybe , um ,
121499:37	say if it was like Greek night or something um , maybe , um , on the barbecue we 'd put , uh , cubes of lamb or I guess lamb used * for Greek . And , um , like a shish kabob , and , um , mushrooms and tomatoes and onions E_S
121514:10	Um , maybe some rolls and , um , I guess *T*-1 some , uh , some rice or something like that . E_S
121525:13	I do n't know E_S

121541:46	and , um , usually we just have very plain kind of , you know , \[ interesting , \+ not very interesting \] meals . Pizza and that all E_S
121575:10	Oh , sure . E_S
121588:20	but , uh I do n't know , E_S
121607:13	I did n't know 0 this was \[ all , \+ from all \] over the whole country . E_S
121666:10	do you know what a fajita is *T*-1 ? E_S
121673:55	I 've been down to Texas a few times , and , uh , had , uh , the pleasure of their good Mexican , cuisine down there . E_S
121688:5	maybe like four chicken breasts , E_S
121695:46	and you take , um , \[ s- , \+ \] little bit , maybe two tablespoons of butter \[ and a fr- , \+ \] in a big frying pan . And chop up some onion and put in oregano and salt , E_S
121702:32	Um , we 're discussing the capital punishment , I believe 0 *T*-1 . E_S
121718:106	but , uh , I guess 0 these people that *T*-1 go around \[ and , \+ and \] kill children and women *ICH*-4 and everything else without any remorse , uh , I do n't think 0 they deserve *-2 \[ to , \+ to \] live and be supported *-3 by us the rest of their lives . E_S
121732:8	I think 0 it needs *-1 to be something , uh , uh , a throwback to where they did a , uh , public execution where it 's visible *T*-2 *T*-3 . E_S
121736:22	Uh , something , you know , not gruesome E_S \[ but , \+ but \] something more where people know that \[ it , \+ it \] was a deterrent and it was equal for all people *T*-1 . E_S
121736:65	Uh , something , you know , not gruesome E_S \[ but , \+ but \] something more where people know that \[ it , \+ it \] was a deterrent and it was equal for all people *T*-1 . E_S
121737:17	If you committed a certain crime , you were going *-1 to receive a death penalty E_S
121746:44	Well , and \[ even , \+ even \] that I do n't really know if that would help . E_S
121747:8	I think 0 a lot of these people do it , uh , mainly because of , of T V E_S
121755:23	I mean , they become well known . E_S
121759:39	\[ but , \+ but \] \[ they , \+ they \] know that their chances of * actually receiving the death penalty are minimal . E_S
121763:8	They know that they will probably be out in ten to twelve years . E_S
121763:21	They know that they will probably be out in ten to twelve years . E_S
121781:43	Well , \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] think 0 if they went according to , uh , the BIBLE where it does say , an eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth , a life for a life *T*-1 , E_S
121792:24	Uh , uh , that 's for sure . E_S
121795:14	but , you know , most of these people that *T*-1 down right go right \[ and , \+ and \] do it out of pure pleasure uh , I do n't , uh , like *-2 to see that . E_S
121795:83	but , you know , most of these people that *T*-1 down right go right \[ and , \+ and \] do it out of pure pleasure uh , I do n't , uh , like *-2 to see that . E_S
121833:51	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] guess 0 I been thinking about it E_S
121835:31	but , uh , repeat , uh , crimes uh , maybe not \[ the , \+ the \] more mild ones but , you know , \[ a \+ \] more severe ones especially \[ on , \+ on \] armed robbery and stuff where they been taking from elderly people , and not just taking the money but beating them half to death *T*-1 . E_S
121835:72	but , uh , repeat , uh , crimes uh , maybe not \[ the , \+ the \] more mild ones but , you know , \[ a \+ \] more severe ones especially \[ on , \+ on \] armed robbery and stuff where they been taking from elderly people , and not just taking the money but beating them half to death *T*-1 . E_S
121845:11	Just for pleasure too E_S
121852:15	Why , you know , \[ \[ y- , \+ y- , \] \+ you \] could carry it to that \[ if , \+ uh , if \] they are a repeat offender E_S
121853:24	\[ and , \+ and \] you know that as soon as you let them out on the streets they are going *-1 to do this . E_S
121906:15	but I do n't know what *-1 to do *T*-2 *-3 to stop it . E_S
121915:12	They would think 0 it did n't mean them , I guess 0 *T*-1 . E_S
121934:21	So your privacy is invaded *-1 probably by other members of the family . E_S
121944:18	Oh , I do n't know . E_S
121959:43	* Try *-1 to remember *-2 to respect their privacy , E_S and maybe they will respect yours E_S
121962:18	Well , I do n't know . E_S
121986:37	I would get in the bathroom and lock the door so maybe they could n't hear me , E_S
121992:38	but I could n't get them to hang up , you know . E_S
122011:44	and she 'll just sit there and listen like I 'm doing something wrong , E_S
122016:14	But , you know , it gets annoying when they stand right over you *-1 watching everything 0 you do *T*-2 *T*-3 . E_S
122023:13	I ca n't think of anything else 0 I 'd really consider *T*-1 an invasion of privacy other than the phone solicitors . E_S
122031:79	Well , occasionally we 'll have a person here or there , but \[ not , \+ not \] as many as the phone calls , you know , E_S
122038:13	I ca n't think , tha- , N_S
122062:103	and you would like *-1 to , feel like it 's an invasion of privacy because you ca n't even ride down the road without people all the way around you , you know . E_S
122084:30	so when I first moved here *T*-1 I probably did consider that an invasion of privacy E_S
122085:66	because \[ it , \+ at \] first you 'd hear a lot of noise , especially at night you know , when you go to bed *T*-1 . E_S
122099:102	because \[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] remember *-2 waking up in several years at night when I 'd hear a fire truck go by *T*-1 , you know . E_S
122104:8	I think 0 they would probably have *-1 to pull into my drive before it bothered me . E_S
122104:21	I think 0 they would probably have *-1 to pull into my drive before it bothered me . E_S
122108:10	so that probably would n't bother me . E_S
122132:14	and , you know , I thought 0 he , N_S
122132:22	and , you know , I thought 0 he , N_S
122138:8	I thought 0 he would respect me more than that , *-1 to look through my things and not trust me , E_S
122161:29	Uh , I 'm trying *-1 to just think of the ones that *T*-2 have come on . E_S
122162:24	Uh , WHITE PALACE which I thought 0 *T*-1 was \[ over rated , \+ over hyped , \] um , recently . E_S
122166:10	Well , maybe \[ you , \+ uh , you \] have seen DANCES WITH WOLVES . E_S
122174:14	What did you think *T*-1 of that one ? E_S
122179:13	Um , I thought 0 \[ \[ the , \+ uh , the cima- , \] \+ the cinematography \] was excellent . E_S
122214:124	and , uh , just every time 0 I would start *-1 to get into the movie *T*-2 , and it was getting good *T*-2 someone in the crowd would yell , hey , there 's John Red Eagle , you know E_S
122218:14	or , you know , they 'd start *-1 recognizing people . E_S
122225:31	So , \[ I kind of , \+ I think \] 0 I enjoyed it more *ICH*-4 \[ when I , \+ when I \] watched it on video cassette *T*-1 than I did , uh , in the movie theater because my attention would get diverted *-2 every time 0 they 'd say that *T*-3 . E_S
122226:55	I 'd go \[ now , \+ now \] which one could that be *T*-1 you know , E_S
122239:39	\[ So , \+ but \] \[ I , \+ I \] thought 0 it was a good film . E_S
122241:13	\[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 it was very one sided . E_S
122241:24	\[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 it was very one sided . E_S
122244:64	but it 's a side 0 that has n't been told *T*-1 . Uh , as far as , you know , * telling it from , you know , the Indians as the good guys and the , the white men as the bad guys . E_S
122244:89	but it 's a side 0 that has n't been told *T*-1 . Uh , as far as , you know , * telling it from , you know , the Indians as the good guys and the , the white men as the bad guys . E_S
122245:26	\[ I , \+ I \] really thought about , uh , all \[ the , \+ the \] westerns that we have seen *T*-1 for years and years , E_S
122268:11	Now I thought 0 that was a good show . E_S
122283:70	\[ It was , \+ it was \] kind of like the STAR WARS \[ s- , \+ series , \] you know , just something a little different , yet believable . E_S
122293:13	I do n't know , E_S
122294:27	\[ I had a , \+ I sure did have a \] mind lock about the movies 0 I 've seen *T*-1 . E_S
122308:8	I think 0 I 've missed one . E_S
122309:13	I 'm not sure , E_S
122310:10	but I think 0 I 've missed one . E_S
122334:65	Uh , well , \[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 it 's a subject 0 I have n't thought too much about *T*-1 . E_S
122335:18	Uh , I do n't know if there 's so much wrong with the public schools , uh , as much as , we 're expecting too much out of them . E_S
122335:38	Uh , I do n't know if there 's so much wrong with the public schools , uh , as much as , we 're expecting too much out of them . E_S
122339:13	Uh , that might be a lot 0 *T*-1 to do with it . E_S
122340:8	I know 0 a lot of it here in my state , N_S
122342:13	I 'm not sure where you 're from *T*-1 . E_S
122379:37	Cause if you ca n't pay the right people , you know , \[ they 're not *-1 to be able *-2 to do , \+ they 're \[ not , \+ not \] going *-3 to get \] the people that *T*-4 can do a good job . E_S
122384:72	* talking on a lot of the things as far as the discipline in the schools , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 they 're expecting schools to discipline the kids E_S
122385:17	and , uh , I think 0 it should go right back to the parents .
122403:23	\[ I , \+ I \] know 0 when I , uh , was going to school *T*-1 it *EXP*-3 was n't uncommon for a teacher to strike a student that *T*-2 was misbehaving . E_S
122408:36	I mean they do that now E_S and they could probably lose their job . E_S
122421:8	It seems 0 that 'd be a subject that \[ I , \+ I \] do n't have much 0 *-1 to say *T*-2 on *T*-3 . E_S
122431:8	I know 0 \[ a lot , \+ a lot of , \] N_S
122441:8	I know 0 one of my physics professors at college has addressed this . E_S
122444:10	And they may not know a lot about what they 're teaching *T*-1 . E_S
122444:15	And they may not know a lot about what they 're teaching *T*-1 . E_S
122445:12	Where they may have just had a teaching major and then had some social studies courses *T*-1 E_S
122447:15	And they do n't know a lot about that . E_S
122451:9	Where maybe a physics professor , N_S
122459:13	I do n't know , E_S
122460:32	\[ \[ e- , \+ e- , \] \+ maybe \] they should sit back \[ and , \+ and \] kind of , uh , decide on where the money 's best spent *-1 *T*-2 . E_S
122461:8	I know 0 in a lot of cases , uh , different districts like *-1 to have nice fancy schools . E_S
122465:7	And maybe they should be a little more , uh , uh , concerned with *-1 paying the right people *-2 to teach \[ and , \+ and \] be , uh , satisfied with maybe a little older school . E_S
122465:102	And maybe they should be a little more , uh , uh , concerned with *-1 paying the right people *-2 to teach \[ and , \+ and \] be , uh , satisfied with maybe a little older school . E_S
122474:29	And the other schools were built *-1 back in maybe the fifties or early sixties E_S
122476:76	\[ \[ \[ and this \+ and this \] \+ and this \] \+ and so it \] kind of would make you think that we 'd all be better off if all the schools were blown *-1 away by tornadoes and we had *-2 to rebuild them . E_S
122480:26	Well \[ I , \+ I \] know , uh , 0 where I came from *T*-1 . We did n't have a very , uh , rich community E_S
122482:27	and , uh , as far as I know , it 's still there . E_S
122485:13	and it 's probably fifty , sixty years old \[ or , \+ or \] better E_S
122496:22	And , uh , I do n't know E_S
122499:8	It sure is *?* . E_S
122528:11	It 's probably up there to twenty now if I MUMBLEx \[ * to \+ \] start again . E_S
122535:23	\[ I , \+ I \] know 0 with \[ our , \+ our \] long winters \[ I , \+ I \] enjoy *-1 watching it . E_S
122536:13	I do n't know if it 's just because I like the game or I just like *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] see the warm weather . E_S
122582:8	I know what you mean *T*-1 . E_S
122586:16	or something would go wrong E_S
122604:21	I 'd say 0 we probably have within fifteen miles , twenty golf communities built * around courses that *T*-1 are pretty well designed and then of course , Pine Hurst E_S
122639:10	Are you sure 0 you guys are n't having the bad weather ? E_S
122661:34	\[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] know what *T*-1 changed that pattern . E_S
122664:15	It 's been probably five years since we 've had any measurable snowfall . E_S
122712:8	I think 0 it *EXP*-1 's pretty exciting that they can , uh , N_S
122713:114	it *EXP*-3 would be interesting * to see if they can find , uh , other planets \[ that *T*-1 are , \+ that *T*-2 will be \] more habitable to , uh , you know , uh , humans E_S
122715:8	I think 0 I would be very interested in space travel in the future \[ \[ if , \+ uh , if it , \] \+ you know , if it \] is at all possible . E_S

122722:13	but I 'm probably getting a little too old for that . E_S
122724:13	Well , I know if they make the advances that they have been making *T*-1 , that , uh , maybe \[ age will no longer , \+ age \] or even physical , uh , abilities may not be , uh , a barrier anymore . E_S
122724:65	Well , I know if they make the advances that they have been making *T*-1 , that , uh , maybe \[ age will no longer , \+ age \] or even physical , uh , abilities may not be , uh , a barrier anymore . E_S

122729:8	I think 0 a lot of \[ our , \+ our \] technology 0 we have *T*-1 \[ is , \+ is \] quite a bit due to lot of the space travel , uh , uh , equipment and stuff that , N_S
122734:56	I have been to Houston *-1 \[ \[ to , \+ to , \] \+ you know , to \] visit the , uh , space center out there , E_S

122743:21	It 's amazing , you know , E_S

122983:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think that any company or anything that *T*-1 wants *-2 to contribute to a fund should be able *-3 to do that , and be registered *-4 with what they ever contribute *T*-5 . E_S
123004:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 * to bring it in line you are going *-1 to have *-2 to have a generation that *T*-3 's going *-4 to really bite the bullet *-5 to bring it in line . E_S
123091:13	I do n't know that it would *?* or would n't *?* . E_S
123140:41	the Saints are starting *-1 to impress me this year , you know , a lot . E_S
123171:18	Oh , I ca n't believe that . E_S
123178:8	I know . E_S
123198:15	Well , do you think 0 \[ they 're , \+ they 're \] going *-1 to be able *-2 to make it this year , past the first playoff game ? E_S
123200:27	Uh \[ I s- , \+ I sure \] hope so . E_S
123203:18	\[ I 'm not sure , \+ I 'm not sure \] who they play *T*-1 . E_S
123203:34	\[ I 'm not sure , \+ I 'm not sure \] who they play *T*-1 . E_S
123216:14	What do you think *T*-1 about , uh , Houston ? E_S
123237:54	\[ he 's \+ he definitely , uh , is \] one of the best I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
123292:30	Well \[ \[ I , \+ you know , I , \] \+ I \] was never really a big Dallas fan until we moved here E_S
123311:15	Well , do you know anything about the expansion teams 0 they 're thinking about * bringing *T*-1 in ? E_S
123311:44	Well , do you know anything about the expansion teams 0 they 're thinking about * bringing *T*-1 in ? E_S
123319:18	Uh , right now I think 0 this Memphis , \[ they 're , \+ they 're \] trying *-1 to get the teams . E_S
123331:15	but I 'm not sure . E_S
123333:10	You know , I think 0 you are right . E_S
123333:18	You know , I think 0 you are right . E_S
123334:8	I think 0 it is Raleigh . E_S
123338:8	I think 0 I remember *-1 hearing that . E_S
123341:11	Because I know 0 they 've got a MUMBLEx football team E_S
123342:10	but I think 0 it might be them . E_S
123342:20	but I think 0 it might be them . E_S
123348:8	I think 0 they are supposed *-1 to put two in by either next year or the year after . E_S
123349:15	And right now I think 0 \[ Memphis and , \+ it 's Memphis and \] I think Baltimore 0 *T*-1 have a really good shot at it . E_S
123349:57	And right now I think 0 \[ Memphis and , \+ it 's Memphis and \] I think Baltimore 0 *T*-1 have a really good shot at it . E_S
123353:11	Because I know 0 Saint Louis is much bigger than Memphis E_S
123395:13	I 'm not sure about October . E_S
123396:8	I think 0 for about twelve months through September \[ the , \+ the \] average temperature has been higher than normal each month .
123410:37	But , uh , \[ we had , uh , you know , all these , \+ we have all these , \] uh , N_S
123411:18	somebody said , you know , 0 you 're either a stranger or a fool *-1 to try *-2 to predict Texas weather , E_S
123421:20	just pouring down , you know . E_S
123424:73	and then uh , into of November , \[ \[ the first , \+ like the second \] week , \+ uh , you know , the first week \] actually , \[ we had , \+ we had \] a freeze , E_S
123428:26	and \[ the average , \+ you know , the average , \] uh , first frost is like the fifteenth of November here E_S
123436:8	I think 0 we usually have a frost in October . E_S
123440:19	Uh , but , you know . We really need the rain that we 've been getting *T*-1 , E_S
123448:27	I mean , that 's occurred *-1 certainly at times in the past , E_S
123453:90	we 're supposed *-1 to have a chance * to get some rain the next couple of days here , uh , which *T*-2 will be , you know , a little bit more typical , uh , autumn weather .
123460:10	you know , the poor trees , said what , E_S
123473:21	there , you , you know , N_S
123476:12	and you know , all these huge trees just like the eastern hard wood belt all the way up to Maine , you know , E_S
123476:66	and you know , all these huge trees just like the eastern hard wood belt all the way up to Maine , you know , E_S
123477:53	it 's that same trees , pines \[ and , \+ and \] hard woods , you know hickories and oaks and stuff , E_S
123485:10	You know , \[ the , \+ the \] freeze just got them . E_S
123491:19	Not much color , you know , changes have occurred at all . E_S
123493:13	I 'm not sure \[ what that , \+ what that \] means *T*-1 . E_S
123495:13	I do n't know . E_S
123498:8	I think 0 it was an especially good winter for fall colors . E_S
123517:18	That 's , you know , N_S
123518:8	I think 0 you could drive along in Maryland and look at the sweet gum trees on each side \[ and the , \+ and the \] pines and what not , E_S
123519:28	and \[ you could , \+ you know , you could \] be driving along in East Texas
123521:21	It 's almost , you know , identical kind of country . E_S
123552:18	like the white oaks \] seem *-1 to be pretty hardy . E_S
123558:41	the dogwoods \[ still look , \+ still look , \] you know ,
123654:13	I do n't know who *T*-1 played when and who *T*-2 does what like some guys are *?* . E_S
123664:40	so I 'm more *ICH*-1 into college football than professional , I think 0 *T*-2 . E_S
123698:48	\[ I have n't , \+ \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know , I 've \] thought a lot about labor and delivery E_S
123698:62	\[ I have n't , \+ \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know , I 've \] thought a lot about labor and delivery E_S
123699:15	but I do n't know . E_S
123733:17	Uh , I guess probably going on twenty years now . E_S
123770:13	uh , I think 0 Texas , San Antonio in particular , has got a large , uh , base of hospitals . E_S
123771:18	Uh , I do n't know about Dallas . E_S
123772:8	I think 0 Dallas is pretty scattered . E_S
123790:28	So if * ever wanted , you know , pursue anything more than your nursing degree , \[ that , \+ that 'd \] be the place 0 * to do it *T*-1 . E_S
123810:7	and maybe we 'll meet up again some time . E_S
123844:8	It seems like a lot of my neighbors kind of have a similar type , I do n't know , life . E_S
123844:56	It seems like a lot of my neighbors kind of have a similar type , I do n't know , life . E_S
123879:8	I know 0 my husband takes an awful lot of time on the weekends , not so much now , but * to , um , maintain the lawn and the edging and the flower beds , E_S
123883:8	It certainly is *?* . E_S
123885:11	sometimes I think , um , 0 it *EXP*-1 would be nice * to have a town home , with * not having all that responsibility . E_S
123887:34	Well , if you ever get one , * be sure 0 the walls are good and thick because if they 're not *?* you can hear . E_S
123889:25	I wanted *-1 to make * sure 0 \[ I could , \+ I could n't \] hear my neighbors E_S
123895:28	once you 're inside , you do n't know 0 you 're in a town home . E_S
123907:39	So \[ in , \+ in \] your area then there 's probably a lot of , um , career type people that *T*-1 have those type homes E_S
123916:27	So the people that *T*-1 move here seem *-2 to move from all over the country , which we 're from , um , *T*-3 the northeast , E_S
123917:17	and , um , * seems like a people \[ just do n't , \+ or also do n't \] have any family around . E_S
123919:19	\[ and \+ you know , um . But , \] um MUMBLEx , N_S
123921:24	Well , we also in this area seem *-1 to have a lot of retirees people who *T*-2 do n't want the heat of Florida but do n't want \[ the heat of the , \+ the cold of the \] northeast E_S
123949:79	\[ and , \+ and , \] um , uh , the landscape is much different *ICH*-1 here in Texas than it is *?* , you know , in the north . Um , or even where you are *T*-2 . E_S
123973:46	and if you did n't do anything about it , then they *ICH*-1 'd probably the leaves just blow away . E_S
123979:29	do we have *-1 to speak for a certain amount of time ? E_S
123982:13	I do n't think so . E_S
124005:23	\[ I , \+ I \] know that \[ the amount of , \+ or how far your \] dollar goes *T*-1 probably more than anything \[ has , \+ has \] greatly changed . E_S

124010:8	I know , 0 \[ they , \+ they \] did a , N_S

124018:21	And even though the son was probably more successful , you know , higher up in \[ the , \+ the \] management ladder uh , \[ his , \+ he \] was actually making less money \[ when you co- , \+ when you go \] by costs of living *T*-1 . E_S
124018:37	And even though the son was probably more successful , you know , higher up in \[ the , \+ the \] management ladder uh , \[ his , \+ he \] was actually making less money \[ when you co- , \+ when you go \] by costs of living *T*-1 . E_S

124044:14	and , you know , he could see a movie for like a nickel and things like that . E_S
124047:28	well , \[ I , \+ I \] know 0 gas prices have definitely jumped , uh , from , uh , N_S
124048:8	I know 0 I used *-1 to pay twenty-five cents a gallon E_S
124053:13	I do n't know what it 's *T*-1 , uh , by you . E_S
124055:10	but I think 0 it 's about a dollar fifteen on an average . E_S
124088:25	Um , um , and I do n't think 0 this would have anything 0 *T*-1 to do with it , E_S
124093:43	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] do n't think 0 \[ they , \+ they \] consider , N_S

124110:38	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] know 0 a lot of the things \[ that , \+ that \] \[ we wear , \+ men wear *T*-1 \] nowadays \[ were , \+ would have been \] considered *-2 , uh , feminine , uh , many years ago , E_S
124111:12	but . I know , 0 \[ it 's been , \+ it was \] hard for me at first , E_S
124116:28	but now I kind of like , you know , a lot of the bright colors . E_S
124140:13	I do n't think that there 's anything as original , E_S
124152:5	maybe some day
124153:8	I probably wo n't be alive *-1 to see it , E_S
124154:10	but prices might go down lot more . E_S
124158:13	I do n't know though , E_S
124161:18	Well , \[ I think , \+ *-1 thinking back , I think \] 0 the only style 0 I hope 0 *T*-2 does n't come back is bell bottoms . E_S

124181:48	Well , that is n't \[ a , \+ a \] true false or right or wrong test here . E_S
124184:20	Uh , uh , you know , I would like *-1 to say the Rangers , E_S
124207:14	What did you think *T*-1 of the World Series ? E_S
124216:64	and I \[ was kind of , \+ \] uh , did n't have much interest in the Twins , you know , E_S
124219:36	and one of them broadcast every Twins game live , you know , E_S
124227:36	There 's was Twins *ICH*-1 there , or , you know Skip Williams . E_S
124236:29	but \[ it was int- , \+ it certainly was \] an exciting Series , anyway . E_S

124241:14	What do you think 0 *T*-1 going *-2 to happen to the Rangers ? E_S
124247:11	I was sure hopeful anyway . E_S
124248:64	When we moved down *T*-1 , uh , I was able *-2 to go to my first , you know baseball game , and thought , this is great ,
124248:75	When we moved down *T*-1 , uh , I was able *-2 to go to my first , you know baseball game , and thought , this is great ,
124260:33	and , uh , it was just exciting , you know , E_S
124264:57	But when you go to the ball park *T*-1 , it 's really not all that far you know , E_S
124272:10	You know , but , oh , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 * going to the ball park just really makes it . Because then you watch it on T V you feel like you 're more a part of it too . E_S

124278:20	so I love , you know , baseball teams , E_S
124286:43	and he , uh , says 0 he 's coming back , you know , uh , E_S
124290:13	he does n't know how many years I mean , * to pitch *T*-1 . E_S
124295:60	and he said 0 he 's been saying one more , and it 's been two and three , might be two and three more . E_S
124307:10	You know , and he said , I get a kick out of it , you know , E_S
124307:53	You know , and he said , I get a kick out of it , you know , E_S
124313:19	and he , N_S you know
124314:54	when he quits at *-1 being active *T*-2 , he will go into , you know * \[ being a , \+ \] managing and , yeah , you know , being a coach , I 'm sure 0 *T*-3 . E_S
124314:97	when he quits at *-1 being active *T*-2 , he will go into , you know * \[ being a , \+ \] managing and , yeah , you know , being a coach , I 'm sure 0 *T*-3 . E_S

124321:36	But , \[ he 's , \+ uh , he \] certainly is a good example , uh , for the kids . E_S
124325:10	You know , you like *-1 to have someone like that 0 you could point to *T*-2 say , * see what a fine man , that , he is *T*-3 . E_S
124327:10	You know , some of the , N_S
124332:29	And it *EXP*-1 's just incredible * to think that \[ there 's , \+ uh , there are \] players who *T*-2 are the sons of ball players that *T*-3 used *-4 to play against Nolan or with Nolan , you know , E_S
124332:139	And it *EXP*-1 's just incredible * to think that \[ there 's , \+ uh , there are \] players who *T*-2 are the sons of ball players that *T*-3 used *-4 to play against Nolan or with Nolan , you know , E_S
124338:42	Oh , he 's been a legend for so many years , you know , E_S
124339:15	and I do n't know , E_S
124349:8	I think 0 it was a little early part of the summer , E_S
124367:25	A game is a game , you know . E_S
124368:67	Well , the Rangers really , uh , knocked the socks off of them , which you would expect *T*-1 you know , anyway , E_S
124372:15	but Nolan I think 0 *T*-2 took himself out after a couple of innings *ICH*-1 or something , you know , of the game E_S
124372:65	but Nolan I think 0 *T*-2 took himself out after a couple of innings *ICH*-1 or something , you know , of the game E_S
124377:24	So what do you , uh , think 0 *T*-1 is \[ the , \+ uh , the \] worst culprit for air pollution ? E_S
124379:13	Well , I think 0 \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] probably a combination of things . E_S
124379:45	Well , I think 0 \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] probably a combination of things . E_S
124380:87	Um , factories \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 burn coal as \[ a , \+ an \] energy source with sulfur and nitrogen contaminants , you know , E_S
124385:30	Uh , those are the ones 0 I think 0 *T*-1 primarily contribute to acid rain , E_S
124386:10	and I think 0 \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] probably hurting us a little bit . E_S

124387:29	\[ It 's hurting , \+ you know , it 's hurting \] Germany *ICH*-1 , for example , too , and some other parts of Europe \[ where they , \+ where they \] have high industry *T*-2 . E_S
124392:70	it *EXP*-1 's hard * to put the finger on , uh , what *T*-2 's worse , \[ you \+ know , \] the acid rain situation or the ozone depletion , um , with , uh , your hydrocarbons , uh causing the damage in which , N_S
124398:10	but I know 0 we have n't cured it yet by a long shot . E_S
124407:20	but it 's , you know , really bad on the environment . E_S
124418:12	and , you know , \[ how , \+ how \] we are *T*-1 with our love affair with the auto E_S
124424:8	I know , E_S
124434:34	but it 's part of the inspection sticker , you know , E_S
124437:31	and so \[ that 's , \+ you know , that 's \] the way 0 they 're dealing with it here *T*-1 . E_S
124450:19	and , uh , you know , there 's no way 0 I would put in a lot of money *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] repair it * to meet standards *T*-2 . E_S
124455:11	It 'd probably be difficult anyway . E_S
124466:10	you know a lot of places are burning wood E_S
124472:35	I 've got a place in the country , you know E_S
124476:42	and , uh , they 've had \[ catalytic con- , \+ you know , catalytic converters \] on those , on , N_S
124477:13	uh , I think 0 they 're required *-1 in California and Oregon \[ and , \+ and \] Washington , E_S
124481:64	\[ it 's , \+ it 's \] a plate that *T*-1 fits \[ in , \+ you know , into \] the smoke pipe E_S
124486:37	The more smoke 0 *T*-2 is produced *-1 , you know , N_S
124490:35	but \[ that , \+ that \] sounds like that might help *-1 solve that problem even on you know , \[ \[ old , \+ old , \] \+ uh , older \] stoves that *T*-2 do n't have any kind of E P A requirements on them . E_S
124490:64	but \[ that , \+ that \] sounds like that might help *-1 solve that problem even on you know , \[ \[ old , \+ old , \] \+ uh , older \] stoves that *T*-2 do n't have any kind of E P A requirements on them . E_S
124494:8	That might help a little bit , especially in some places . E_S
124501:39	especially \[ in , \+ in , \] uh , autumn it seem like we get kind of a brown haze sitting on us , E_S
124510:21	well it depends , you know , E_S
124512:20	and in the summer time we probably get yours . E_S
124521:11	I really think , uh , you know , 0 we 're doing \[ some , \+ some \] important things . E_S
124521:26	I really think , uh , you know , 0 we 're doing \[ some , \+ some \] important things . E_S
124523:13	uh , I know 0 school kids , N_S
124525:19	and , uh , you know , this is one of the big things with kids . E_S
124526:46	Kids are writing letters to the newspapers \[ about , \+ \] you know , telling adults *-1 to clean up their act E_S
124530:25	and , it 's uh , you know , N_S
124537:8	I know 0 it has nothing 0 *T*-1 to do with air pollution , E_S
124545:10	So I thought 0 that was kind of an \[ in- , \+ interesting \] coincidence . E_S
124582:13	but it 's probably going *-1 to take me longer , because I did n't decide *-2 to major in that until , uh , about a year and a half after I was already in school , E_S
124585:10	You know , I read a study once , E_S
124598:40	if you 're management , \[ you , \+ you , \] thought , \[ I , \+ I 'll \] take that marketing , E_S
124599:34	it 's just only was three more classes you know , E_S
124611:79	My advice \[ is \+ is , \] uh , * look \[ for , \+ at \] the student to faculty ratio , you know , E_S
124614:82	if you 're going *-1 to go to a college where student faculty ratio is three and four hundred to one *T*-3 , I do n't think 0 you 're going *-2 to have as meaningful of a college experience as if you 're down to the thirty to forty to one . E_S
124631:22	Which *T*-1 is , you know , N_S
124634:13	what I thought 0 *T*-1 was nice is 0 \[ you could al- , \+ there was always \] time 0 * to talk to professor , you know *T*-2 , E_S
124634:98	what I thought 0 *T*-1 was nice is 0 \[ you could al- , \+ there was always \] time 0 * to talk to professor , you know *T*-2 , E_S
124639:31	You were n't just in their class , you know , E_S
124641:60	\[ and , \+ or \] if you ran into them in the student union or whatever , you know , you could sit down , talk to them about a problem . E_S
124656:14	and , you know , \[ it , \+ it \] just was n't the same . E_S

124690:16	And he only has certain office hours , E_S
124691:20	and so there 's only certain times 0 you can talk to him *T*-1 , E_S
124701:46	Well , what would *T*-1 be your advice to a parent of a child thinking of * attending college ? E_S
124704:8	I think 0 your advice is good . E_S
124712:22	and , um , I do n't know , E_S
124716:13	I do n't know , E_S
124720:10	You know , you get to the point where \[ it 's , \+ I 'm \] never going *-1 to get done *-2 *T*-3 . E_S
124724:10	You know , \[ I , \+ I \] mean , I was taking summer classes E_S
124731:59	Even if you do n't have your major decided on * , * have an idea what you think 0 you might want *T*-1 , you know , E_S

124737:13	Um , I think 0 I 'm down to one . E_S
124791:28	Um , and I use them , you know , E_S
124792:34	like my American Express I use *T*-1 for , you know , gas , things like that , E_S
124794:46	and then , um , some other credit cards , like store credit cards , you know , I do have them up there a little bit , E_S

124883:71	Uh , I would n't mind , uh , you know , *-1 getting back into one if they would , you know , N_S
124912:17	So , I do n't know , E_S

124942:6	may be , E_S you 're the furthest person *ICH*-1 , actually , that I 've talked . E_S
124978:18	Oh , um , I think 0 I 'd still go with the Cadillac . E_S
124986:18	Oh , I do n't know . E_S
124987:21	I guess the Seville , probably or . N_S
124998:45	\[ It , \+ it \] always has been *?* though . You know , E_S

125022:68	Well , I think 0 the ones now with all of the , uh , fancy gold lettering and all , you know ,
125023:8	I think 0 they 're very pretty . E_S

125041:44	\[ they , \+ they \] look like they 're sturdy you know , E_S

125050:196	\[ If , \+ uh , if \] you have a front end accident at such a rate of speed , \[ the e- , \+ the engine \] will actually drop out of the car so that \[ it does n't come through the , \+ \[ so it does n't go , \+ it does n't go \] \[ through the , \+ you know , into the \] \] inside . E_S
125053:18	Oh , I did n't know that . E_S
125078:45	Um , \[ I , \+ I \] go for things , you know , built * in the United States rather than foreign countries . E_S
125098:23	We 've driven them for about probably twenty years . E_S
125112:18	Well , I do n't think , N_S
125117:16	Well I do n't know . E_S
125138:72	That 's always nice * to get , uh , reliability in a product . Especially when you 're spending , you know , anywhere from fifteen to twenty-five thousand dollars \[ for , \+ for \] a single item *T*-1 . You know , E_S
125138:128	That 's always nice * to get , uh , reliability in a product . Especially when you 're spending , you know , anywhere from fifteen to twenty-five thousand dollars \[ for , \+ for \] a single item *T*-1 . You know , E_S

125156:96	but \[ that 's always been something \+ that 's been a key factor \] in me , is how reliable is this car going *-1 to be *T*-2 you know . E_S
125182:8	well sure . E_S
125184:10	You know , it 's American made too which *T*-1 is good . E_S
125203:11	I honestly think 0 I would die before my truck would , keel over on me . E_S
125225:46	if we 're going *-1 to have national health insurance , which *T*-2 seems likely , it 's necessarily going *-3 to involve more taxes . E_S
125230:15	Um , you know , you always sit there E_S
125232:20	and you wonder , you know , where 's it all going *T*-1 E_S
125238:8	I know 0 there 's a lot of social programs *ICH*-2 out there that *T*-1 need help . E_S
125247:72	and Senator Moynihan 's , uh , proposal * \[ \[ to , \+ to , \] \+ to \] cut there I think 0 *T*-1 \[ wou- , \+ makes \] a lot of sense . E_S
125252:8	I think 0 Senator Moynihan 's proposal * \[ to , \+ to \] cut the social security tax which *T*-1 is n't really \[ going * to , \+ going *-2 to \] beef \[ \[ up , \+ up , \] \+ up \] the social security program could make a lot of sense . E_S
125258:103	As far as other countries , \[ I 'm not , \+ um , I do n't \] keep up on it too much as to far \[ as what , \+ you know , as what \] they 're do- . N_S
125259:8	I know N_S
125264:10	and I know that the tax there is extremely high , much higher than we pay here , E_S
125270:13	\[ I think 0 Japan , \+ I think 0 Japan \] is probably about equal to ours E_S
125270:31	\[ I think 0 Japan , \+ I think 0 Japan \] is probably about equal to ours E_S
125270:47	\[ I think 0 Japan , \+ I think 0 Japan \] is probably about equal to ours E_S
125292:69	\[ that 's , \+ that 's \] a scary thing that there 's \[ no , \+ no \] real knowing about *T*-1 . E_S
125324:8	I may have filled out \[ on the , \+ on the \] form , E_S
125325:29	but \[ I , \+ I \] \[ certainly , \+ certainly \] have the feeling 0 I 've been given *-1 topics different from the ones that I mentioned *T*-2 before . E_S
125325:37	but \[ I , \+ I \] \[ certainly , \+ certainly \] have the feeling 0 I 've been given *-1 topics different from the ones that I mentioned *T*-2 before . E_S
125335:18	Oh , I did n't know that . E_S
125338:8	I thought 0 whoever *T*-1 made the call could choose what topic , E_S because I have n't made any calls yet . E_S
125375:17	and , um , I think 0 it *EXP*-1 was really hard * \[ to , \+ um , to \] pick the right , uh , day care or preschool or Mother 's Day Out . E_S
125380:67	Um , some of the qualifications that I look for *T*-1 was \[ that , \+ \] uh , you know , the cost , and , um , exactly what they did *T*-2 , if it was structured or nonstructured , if they had a little academic , um , uh , in there , and , um , you know , um , you know , what the qualifications of the teachers ' were *T*-3 , and if the place was clean and um , the hours E_S

125395:35	So , um , that 's something that I 'm probably going *-1 to be looking at *T*-2 maybe in the future . E_S
125395:60	So , um , that 's something that I 'm probably going *-1 to be looking at *T*-2 maybe in the future . E_S
125401:15	and I do n't know if I 'll be doing that or what we 're going *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S
125410:10	and we know a lot of people at the church E_S
125413:43	That 's a very good place 0 * to start *T*-1 I think 0 *T*-2 . E_S
125423:30	and , uh , the churches always have I think 0 *T*-1 , \[ a , \+ a \] pretty good program , E_S
125424:27	and you have *-1 to make * sure \[ that you , \+ um , that you \] apply pretty early , because \[ they do have , \+ a lot of places have \] very long waiting lists . E_S
125428:85	\[ And , \+ um , and \] another question 0 * to ask *T*-1 is if they 're , um , state certified um , you know , if the teachers have , um , their Master 's degree \[ in , \+ in \] child education and um , child development . E_S
125435:15	Um , you know , \[ what , \+ what \] kind of a structure is it going *-1 to be *T*-2 . E_S
125452:48	So , she does n't have *-1 to necessary take a nap there you know , \[ which *T*-2 is , \+ which *T*-3 is \] nice . Um . E_S
125458:15	Um , you know , it 's kind of scary , I guess 0 *T*-1 , because you hear so many bad things about day cares lately , E_S
125466:84	And sometimes when the child 's a lot younger *T*-1 , \[ before they 're really , \+ um , before three years old , \] you know , like the church is a good program E_S
125467:31	and sometimes you even consider , um , you know , *-1 having a private person come to your own home when they 're real little *T*-2 \[ or \+ or \] something like that , E_S
125479:22	and if your child would be maybe sleeping in that crib all day , N_S
125481:50	\[ and , \+ or \] do they just put any child in any crib you know , N_S
125485:16	you would want , maybe , your child to have their own sheets all the time , and not have another child use that bed you know . E_S
125485:76	you would want , maybe , your child to have their own sheets all the time , and not have another child use that bed you know . E_S
125492:11	I 'm sure that , um , whatever you decide *T*-1 , you 'll be happy with *T*-2 . E_S
125505:24	but \[ that , \+ you know , we have been thinking about that , \] E_S
125505:38	but \[ that , \+ you know , we have been thinking about that , \] E_S
125510:27	but , um , I figure , you know , 0 I 'd probably start *-2 asking around at church because I know 0 they have a limit as to how old they can be *T*-1 \[ before they , \+ you know , before you \] can bring them in . E_S
125510:42	but , um , I figure , you know , 0 I 'd probably start *-2 asking around at church because I know 0 they have a limit as to how old they can be *T*-1 \[ before they , \+ you know , before you \] can bring them in . E_S
125510:71	but , um , I figure , you know , 0 I 'd probably start *-2 asking around at church because I know 0 they have a limit as to how old they can be *T*-1 \[ before they , \+ you know , before you \] can bring them in . E_S

125518:60	\[ \[ \[ Some , \+ some places , um , start them as early as , I think , \] \+ well , some , \] \+ some places \] take them as infants , I guess 0 *T*-1 , you know , like eight weeks , even . E_S

125531:10	you know , some places just specialize in just real little ones E_S
125539:26	But it is a difficult situation , I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
125586:10	but then maybe he 'll catch up on the weekend and go for a run . E_S
125593:62	but \[ I have an ex- , \+ I had an exercise \] bike in the house , but did n't seem *-1 to use it enough , E_S
125601:10	and I know , um , uh , 0 \[ \[ \[ we , \+ we \] \+ both of , \] \+ my husband and I both \+ \] do it *-1 to just keep the pounds off . E_S
125614:13	Oh , I know . E_S
125616:8	I think 0 you feel better , too , if you get on some program like that , E_S
125627:55	and , um , \[ I , \+ I \] enjoy the socialization of it , you know , E_S *-1 getting *-2 to see the same women every morning , E_S
125631:40	but um , there are some parts during that exercise that I think , I can not do another second of this *T*-1 . E_S
125636:8	I know 0 \[ \[ \[ it , \+ it , \] \+ it , \] \+ some of it \] is so tough E_S
125640:54	and , uh , especially when somebody 's , uh , planning lunch for you and they know \[ what , \+ what *T*-1 's \] good for you *T*-2 , E_S
125641:8	I think 0 when we do it ourselves *T*-1 , E_S
125667:33	Well what kind of car , uh , are you thinking of *-2 buying *T*-1 next ? E_S
125695:32	and there 's no reason for it , you know .
125698:13	Well , you know the old sayings about Fords , what they stand for *T*-1 . E_S
125716:19	but , uh , my wife thought 0 she wanted *-1 to get a Ford Mustang E_S
125717:29	and then she kind of changed her mind and thinks 0 her next car ought *-1 to be one of those , uh , Mitsubishi Eclipses . E_S
125740:14	And , you know , when you work nine to five , or eight to five *T*-1 , and you 're in rush hour traffic to and from work , unfortunately *T*-1 . E_S
125758:8	I sure like \[ the , \+ uh , \[ convertible , \+ \] those \] rag top LeBarons , E_S
125768:29	but we bought it in eighty-eight , you know , right at the end of the year when they were trying *-1 to get rid *-2 of them *T*-3 E_S
125773:10	you know , when they 're trying *-1 to get rid *-2 of those cars at the end of the year like that *T*-3 , they really come down on their prices E_S
125774:24	and , uh , uh , you know , we looked around at used cars , E_S
125776:89	because , uh , if you go to the bank and try *-1 to get a loan , they want *-2 to charge twelve , thirteen percent , you know , E_S
125777:23	and we ended up , I think , with like a four and a half percent interest rate on a brand new car , and the payments . E_S
125816:41	and \[ I , \+ I \] really like comfort , you know , *-1 driving along the road and stuff . E_S
125826:39	And if you try *-1 to take anybody , you know , go to the show or go out for supper , and you go as a foursome , N_S
125851:63	Um , uh , well , in the Carolinas \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] just , you know , 0 we 've got a bunch of golf courses around here . E_S
125855:15	but I do n't know . E_S
125864:90	when I go out and play golf *T*-1 it 's usually like \[ at a , \+ at one of these \] par threes that , you know , you , N_S
125875:13	I do n't know E_S
125879:10	And I thought 0 I was really improving and the big break was going *-1 to come E_S
125888:65	but \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] get great distance *-1 hitting it , you know , MUMBLEx across the ground , E_S
125918:10	and I think 0 I 'm doing \[ all , \+ all \] fine E_S
125921:32	Just * walking around the hollow and making * sure 0 there 's not really , N_S
125922:10	you know , * checking the ground \[ and , \+ and \] so forth , you know . E_S
125922:55	you know , * checking the ground \[ and , \+ and \] so forth , you know . E_S
125938:28	Um , well , \[ if \+ you know if \] it 's up on a slope that you 've got *-1 to hit it not kill it E_S
125939:77	but you 've got *-1 to hit enough speed and the right angle that \[ it 's , \+ it 's , \] you know , N_S
125947:13	I do n't know E_S
125948:64	\[ I have , \+ I can \] \[ gi- , \+ get \] it within like , you know , four or five feet or something E_S
125959:13	I do n't know , E_S
125968:46	but \[ that , \+ that \] tee shot , uh , it , you know , N_S
125969:46	when *-2 teeing off *T*-1 \[ i- , \+ I 'll \] go probably a hundred feet across the ground E_S
125991:56	Well , \[ \[ it , \+ it , \] \+ it \] usually takes me about probably \[ two , \+ two \] or three *-1 to get it there E_S
125994:15	uh , uh , maybe one or two putts . E_S
126022:19	I 'm talking to the wrong guy . E_S
126023:15	Your shitty golf is probably the best golf 0 I 've ever seen *T*-1 . E_S
126037:10	You know , I can hit a great drives and think 0 I 'm going *-1 to do all awesome on this hole E_S
126037:35	You know , I can hit a great drives and think 0 I 'm going *-1 to do all awesome on this hole E_S
126067:25	Um , my sense is that something may just have been done *-1 about it by congressmen MUMBLEx E_S
126077:15	Um , but I thought 0 I saw something about it having some kind of provision that people could specify that their phones were not for commercial using E_S
126082:11	I 'm sure 0 that 's true . E_S
126087:13	\[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 government can do that now , E_S
126087:24	\[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 government can do that now , E_S
126118:19	\[ And \+ you know , and then \] \[ what , \+ \] those problems has been eliminated *-1 E_S
126131:10	but I think 0 I 'm not sure if it 's by law just , E_S
126131:25	but I think 0 I 'm not sure if it 's by law just , E_S
126132:11	otherwise I think 0 the practice *ICH*-2 has basically been eliminated *-1 * asking for a phone number . E_S
126139:15	And I do n't think 0 they 're going *-1 to call me and ask me how it 's functioning *T*-2 , E_S
126157:52	Well , anything that you buy *T*-3 um , \[ you ca- , \+ you may \] get put *-1 on \[ the , \+ a , \] uh , preferred list that *T*-4 is purchased *-2 . E_S
126172:14	I 'll be thinking in mind 0 the address is , N_S
126189:13	I do n't know . E_S
126190:8	I think 0 it 's gotten much worse the last , few years . E_S
126197:20	Well , they , you know , N_S
126201:19	so , um , you know , it 's not just the telephone . E_S
126218:10	so * thought , I 'll try MUMBLEx , N_S
126231:16	so I 'm home certain days , E_S
126265:14	what do you think *T*-1 ? . E_S
126267:24	Well , I never gave it any thought myself . E_S
126270:38	I was hoping 0 you could tell me what you thought *T*-1 . E_S
126274:8	I think 0 it might be good for them . E_S
126274:18	I think 0 it might be good for them . E_S
126278:27	But as a mother of two daughters I might be afraid of where they were sent *-1 *T*-2 . E_S
126286:35	because if they do good work in America they 'll probably be sent *-1 to a ghetto . E_S
126291:66	And if they were sent *-1 to a third world country I could n't help but wait *-2 worried , you know . E_S
126297:18	Uh , I do n't think , N_S
126300:13	I do n't know E_S
126301:8	I think 0 maybe \[ it 's , \+ it \] should stay on a voluntary basis . E_S
126301:15	I think 0 maybe \[ it 's , \+ it \] should stay on a voluntary basis . E_S
126303:11	it will probably never happen E_S
126308:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 it *EXP*-1 would be good for , uh , everyone to do something like that E_S
126312:26	well \[ it , \+ it \] probably wo n't *?* . E_S
126316:37	\[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] even know how we 'd pay for it *T*-1 anyway . E_S
126317:18	We ca n't , uh seem *-1 to pay for all the little things 0 we have *T*-2 going now . E_S
126328:22	But , uh , I do n't know E_S
126330:8	it might be a real eye opener , you know . E_S
126330:30	it might be a real eye opener , you know . E_S
126336:13	and then they think , N_S
126337:43	they 're just kind of shocked at that side of town , you know . E_S
126342:8	I probably lived in one of those when I was a little girl *T*-1 . E_S
126356:8	I know . E_S
126363:8	I know it . E_S
126365:8	It seems to me 0 we are , N_S
126374:18	But , what do I know *T*-1 , right ? . E_S
126377:59	I 'm just sitting at home \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , doing laundry today and certainly not up , E_S
126411:13	I do n't think so , E_S
126413:8	Patty might *?* . E_S
126416:10	Oh , sure . E_S

126611:31	Um , Gene Hackman 's a good actor . I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
126630:19	We 've seen that movie probably six times in the last six months . E_S

126793:21	They ask me , you know , what are you doing *T*-1 in a dress E_S

128121:133	Well \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ uh , I \] keep *-1 saying 0 if somebody else would do it with me , \[ I , \+ \] \[ that would be , \+ little bit of peer pressure would help \] considerably . E_S
128125:10	But you seemed *-1 to have \[ s- , \+ solved \] that problem without \[ any , \+ any \] external help . E_S
128130:44	And , uh , if you get one of these mats . You know , go to a store , they normally have these exercise , things , these A B C -s of physical fitness on them . E_S
128139:94	\[ \[ It , \+ it , \] \+ it 's \] just an exercise mat that *T*-1 rolls up E_S so you can put it up , you know , just in the corner . E_S

128186:13	I do n't think 0 it 's going *-1 to happen either , E_S

128224:13	I do n't think 0 * switching back and forth is that big a deal . E_S
128225:8	I think 0 people need *-1 to understand more like what a meter is *T*-3 , instead of how many feet *T*-2 in a meter or something . Just get used to *-4 using all the terms . E_S
128227:10	no one knows what that is *T*-1 . E_S

128240:82	Uh , \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the \] public is just very conservative that way in *-1 refusing *-2 to change measurement systems , uh , money , dollar , coins , anything like that . E_S
128248:8	I think 0 two systems is worse than one , though . E_S

128251:31	and \[ you , \+ you \] make more mistakes *ICH*-3 *-2 doing all the conversions than you would *?* *-1 doing the problems . E_S
128256:28	Well , I mean , unfortunate- , I think 0 people like you *ICH*-2 are relatively rare who *T*-1 are coming up against this problem every day . E_S
128260:8	I think so . E_S
128261:49	\[ Your , \+ your \] average guy jogging down the highway wants *-1 to know how many miles *ICH*-3 it is *T*-2 to his destination . E_S

128310:18	I mean , I think , N_S

128369:10	You know , you have *-1 to be a flexible person *-2 to be able *-3 to go all the way across country to something totally different than what you 're used to *T*-4 .

128388:41	if they 're used to the northern weather then the southern weather they might kind of feel like they need *-1 to go out and play all the time , not be in *-2 studying . If you 're in Florida or California .
128413:10	and also maybe then the parents could pay a third E_S

128446:41	and , you know , \[ there is just , \+ I think 0 it 's just \] trouble waiting * to happen . E_S
128479:8	I thought 0 I 'd better *-1 see that one before I go and see six . E_S
128516:8	You know , that I read in \[ PEOPLE or somewhere , \+ no , it was U S A TODAY \] E_S
128528:50	uh , except that the rumor \[ is , \+ is \] that they still might *?* , E_S
128529:10	but it may not include the entire crew E_S
128536:13	I 'm not sure what the difference in light years between the new generation and \[ the , \+ the \] old guys was *T*-1 . E_S
128538:8	I think 0 it 's a hundred years . E_S
128543:46	Considering that Spock was on \[ an , \+ \] uh , you know , couple weeks ago and that \[ the , \+ the \] very first episode of NEXT GENERATION , they had McCoy . E_S
128558:15	well , you know , he was rear admiral , whatever , you know , E_S
128558:44	well , you know , he was rear admiral , whatever , you know , E_S
128577:10	But I think 0 the script was , you know , just incredible compared to the last one . E_S
128577:32	But I think 0 the script was , you know , just incredible compared to the last one . E_S
128582:13	Well , you know why ? E_S
128602:34	But he directed the one before , uh , I think STAR TREK FOUR , something like that . E_S
128604:49	\[ IN SEARCH OF SPOCK , \+ or , no , JOURNEY HOME , \] I think 0 that was *T*-1 . E_S
128612:8	I think so . E_S
128622:29	Well , I 've gone to , you know , one for real live Trek Convention E_S
128628:24	I saw James Doohan , you know , the guy that *T*-1 plays , uh , Scotty . E_S
128660:20	Uh , trying * to think , N_S
128663:26	And they were referring to , you know , Captain Kirk , E_S
128704:20	I mean , you know , there is lots of areas where Thing saves the day *T*-1 . E_S
128713:15	Uh , you know , just finger hopping . E_S
128721:58	He never \[ did , \+ does \] come in out of a box , I do n't think . E_S
128738:22	that 's what I was thinking *T*-1 . E_S
128750:8	drugs seems *-1 to be \[ re- , \+ related \] to quite a bit of the crime 0 we have *T*-2 now . E_S
128755:17	And , uh , I think 0 that 's a national problem , though . E_S
128778:20	And , uh , I 'm sure 0 you have a lot of students there , uh , and a lot of researchers E_S
128779:25	so \[ you , \+ you \] may have \[ a , \+ you know , perhaps a \] little better economic climate , E_S
128779:48	so \[ you , \+ you \] may have \[ a , \+ you know , perhaps a \] little better economic climate , E_S
128780:27	but , in all your cities now , it seems like \[ th- , \+ there \] is \[ a , \+ a \] crowd that *T*-1 's really effected *-2 by this bill . E_S
128790:30	\[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] sure 0 there is problems with it , E_S
128792:11	Durham has probably got the worst . E_S
128799:33	Um . Well , here , uh , I 'm not sure how many Dallas has had *T*-1 . E_S
128802:28	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't know . E_S
128827:8	I know , 0 like a week or so ago , N_S
128828:60	I live \[ in a , \+ in a \] town house , which *T*-1 is , you know , N_S
128833:10	And nobody thought any different , E_S
128834:11	they just thought 0 she was moving . E_S
128848:14	and we all know one another E_S
128849:52	\[ and , \+ and , \] on our one little section of the street we all know one another and know that we 're not moving and different things like that . E_S
128849:62	\[ and , \+ and , \] on our one little section of the street we all know one another and know that we 're not moving and different things like that . E_S
128854:45	\[ \[ I , \+ I 'm , \] \+ I 'm \] probably \[ the , \+ one of the \] youngest people that *T*-1 live over here . E_S
128859:42	\[ \[ or , \+ or , \] \+ or , \] you know , \[ they 're , \+ they 're \] in their forties \[ or , \+ or \] whatever . E_S
128868:13	Well , I think 0 you hit on one point *ICH*-2 there 0 *T*-1 is 0 you know each other . E_S
128868:59	Well , I think 0 you hit on one point *ICH*-2 there 0 *T*-1 is 0 you know each other . E_S
128884:69	\[ one , \+ one \] thing that *T*-2 effects us is 0 we have apartments that *T*-1 are probably about a half mile away E_S
128895:17	and then before you know it you have drugs and a lot of other things E_S
128896:20	so , uh , I 'm sure 0 that aggravates it also . E_S
128914:16	The usual , I think *T*-1 . E_S
128939:11	so it seems wetter or something like that . E_S
128959:10	And it seems like when the winds blow *T*-1 , \[ it 's really , \+ \] it goes right through you . E_S
128961:8	I thought 0 Utah was cold , E_S
128962:10	but I think 0 Iowa is a lot colder . E_S
128970:13	I do n't think 0 there is any mountains 0 *T*-1 to stop the wind . E_S
128974:13	I do n't think 0 there is any mountains 0 *T*-1 to stop the wind . E_S
128978:20	So the humidity is I think 0 *T*-2 what *T*-1 does it . E_S
128981:8	I think 0 that 's true . E_S
129051:46	\[ it 's got *-1 to be \+ like , it 's \] probably fifty , fifty-five , maybe . E_S
129051:58	\[ it 's got *-1 to be \+ like , it 's \] probably fifty , fifty-five , maybe . E_S
129155:10	so I think 0 I better get into something that I can enjoy the process of * going to school *T*-1 E_S
129164:18	Did you graduate in a certain field E_S
129183:8	you might know her . E_S
129183:11	you might know her . E_S
129186:8	I think 0 she graduated around then , too , though , eighty-seven probably , E_S
129186:42	I think 0 she graduated around then , too , though , eighty-seven probably , E_S
129228:28	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't know . E_S
129229:32	Well , I guess 0 it is right in certain cases .
129237:15	so I do n't know what *T*-1 was decided *-2 . E_S
129241:11	They are probably still in deliberations on it . E_S
129278:30	so you have *-1 to wonder , you know . E_S
129291:14	although , you know , it 's not really revenge because it does n't mean anything to him . E_S
129292:10	You know , \[ he , \+ he \] has no concept of what he has done *T*-1 . E_S
129299:25	but I mean , he does n't seem *-1 to have any regard for \[ anythi- , \+ \] anybody 's life including his own . E_S
129306:56	So , \[ it 's , \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] kind of strange that , you know , N_S
129314:49	Well , I guess 0 in cases like \[ that , \+ \] you know , where the guy would , obviously , go out and do it again *T*-1 I mean , you 've got *-2 to do something . E_S
129320:34	well , it 's funny because when , you know , they interview you before you go on the jury \[ and \+ \] for capital murder *T*-1 ,
129330:22	I was the , I think 0 *T*-2 the ninety eighth person 0 they 'd interviewed *T*-1 . E_S
129334:14	But , you know at the time when the guy kept *-1 saying could you ever convict someone E_S and do you think 0 you 'd ever know beyond a doubt *T*-2 E_S
129334:71	But , you know at the time when the guy kept *-1 saying could you ever convict someone E_S and do you think 0 you 'd ever know beyond a doubt *T*-2 E_S
129334:87	But , you know at the time when the guy kept *-1 saying could you ever convict someone E_S and do you think 0 you 'd ever know beyond a doubt *T*-2 E_S
129337:34	but I ca n't imagine you ever making me that sure of something . E_S
129349:38	Well , that was a subsequent case that we did n't know about *T*-1 . And those jurors do n't know about *T*-1 . E_S
129349:62	Well , that was a subsequent case that we did n't know about *T*-1 . And those jurors do n't know about *T*-1 . E_S
129357:22	so no one else would have known . E_S
129370:44	Well , \[ they ca n't , \+ they can , \] I think 0 *T*-2 in the punishment phase but not in the guilt or innocence because \[ he has n't been , \+ he has n't been \] found *-1 guilty of it . E_S
129383:12	so you know , \[ it 's , \+ \[
129430:18	I mean , I think 0 , you know , normally \[ they , \+ they \] may get out E_S
129430:31	I mean , I think 0 , you know , normally \[ they , \+ they \] may get out E_S
129430:58	I mean , I think 0 , you know , normally \[ they , \+ they \] may get out E_S
129436:13	I do n't know . E_S
129440:16	Personally I do n't know which I would pick *T*-1 if I had a choice for myself . E_S
129443:23	I mean , I do n't know whether I 'd stay in prison or not E_S
129492:32	they took us around on a tour , you know , E_S
129497:33	and it *EXP*-1 is kind of a weird feeling * knowing 0 you 're sitting there saying , like , people have died here . E_S
129518:32	steamed \[ she- , \+ uh , shellfish \] with maybe herbs . E_S
129537:13	Uh , I think 0 hors d'oeuvres are good , too . E_S
129574:36	so \[ I 'm not , \+ I do n't \] know a lot about that . E_S
129591:12	So , we might have some cocktails *ICH*-1 ahead of time and maybe \[ some , \+ uh , some \] dip , uh , some cheese . E_S
129591:39	So , we might have some cocktails *ICH*-1 ahead of time and maybe \[ some , \+ uh , some \] dip , uh , some cheese . E_S
129592:69	One of our favorites is , uh , * to take some , * let 's see Philadelphia cream cheese I think , is that what *T*-1 comes in those little blocks ? And pour cocktail sauce over the top of it and then get these little canned shrimp and , uh , wash them and cool them and then dump them in the , uh , sauce and then take crackers E_S
129606:25	and then , uh , I do n't know what we usually have *T*-1 for dessert . E_S
129612:68	But \[ \[ that 's , \+ I guess 0 when you talk about dinner party *T*-2 , that 's probably not , \] \+ uh , that 's more for like \] when friends come over *T*-1 . E_S
129630:13	I do n't know if you 've heard of her . E_S
129635:34	and she talks about catering and , uh , you know , \[ goes into , \+ goes into \] all that and the \[ different types of , \+ uh , uh , different types of \] parties , you know , different types of foods . E_S
129635:124	and she talks about catering and , uh , you know , \[ goes into , \+ goes into \] all that and the \[ different types of , \+ uh , uh , different types of \] parties , you know , different types of foods . E_S
129644:32	so it 's not really anything *ICH*-1 , you know , that I want *-2 to , N_S
129663:29	I have *-1 to get *-2 to know this area a little better , I guess 0 *T*-3 . E_S
129670:56	Um , and he 's not interested in *-1 letting his twenty-one year old daughter experiment with it probably . E_S
129689:13	\[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 * decorating your food is , you know , really , N_S

129689:56	\[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 * decorating your food is , you know , really , N_S
129747:30	I guess 0 \[ it \+ you know , it \] does go in cycles , E_S
129756:85	And \[ I , \+ I \] was so relieved because I 've been making a real concerted effort , *-1 \[ make , \+ \] you know , recycling the aluminum and the newspapers and even got into plastic because Wal-Mart collected it . E_S
129770:8	I know . E_S
129811:20	But , uh , you know , but \[ it , \+ it 's \] not that hard now that I 've got this system under control . E_S
129841:22	And , uh , I do n't know what they could do more of *T*-1 exactly around here right now other than , uh , N_S
129843:24	Oh , one thing 0 I thought about *T*-1 the other day were batteries , E_S
129844:26	just everyday regular batteries . Supposedly , you know , leak \[ and , \+ and \] contaminate the landfills E_S
129870:29	kind of a pain * to , you know , drive over somewhere special \[ just for that , \+ for two \] little tiny batteries E_S
129875:10	but I think 0 the city one could possibly look into that or something . E_S
129881:11	I 'm sure 0 if \[ p- , \+ people \] will have batteries *ICH*-2 , uh , you know , quite often 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] toss *T*-1 out . E_S
129881:65	I 'm sure 0 if \[ p- , \+ people \] will have batteries *ICH*-2 , uh , you know , quite often 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] toss *T*-1 out . E_S
129887:122	Uh , when I was home those few days around Thanksgiving *T*-1 and \[ the , \+ uh , the \] truck came by *T*-1 , well , we all ran out *-2 to watch it because , you know , we 'd never really seen it pick up our stuff E_S
129891:21	and one thing 0 I thought 0 *T*-1 was interesting was that the driver had something on his belt that he , uh , scanned *T*-2 across the little bar code on our bin as soon as he took the stuff E_S
129898:51	and he just pulled this thing kind of out of his pocket and just , you know , scanned it , E_S
129899:16	so I do n't know \[ why , \+ what \] that was reading it for *T*-1 E_S
129907:41	they must be trying *-1 to keep track of , you know , who *T*-2 is doing it , or what , I guess 0 *T*-3 . E_S
129911:13	I do n't know . E_S
129922:15	Well , except I know 0 it would just not be cost effective . E_S
129924:11	I 'm sure 0 they could n't afford that . E_S
129958:22	Is n't that sad ? You know . E_S
129964:8	You know , E_S
129971:101	I mean , of course , we were hoping 0 \[ we were n't , \+ we were n't \] going *-1 to have *-2 to pay for it , you know E_S
129979:41	Well , \[ \[ I , \+ I 'm \] not really certain how I , \+ uh , I 'm not certain \[ that , \+ that \] it \] does a lot of good . I mean , that it \[ ends up , \+ ends up \] *-2 effectively , uh , uh , uh , avoiding a lot of the crimes that *T*-1 have capital \[ punishment \+ penalties . \] E_S
129979:70	Well , \[ \[ I , \+ I 'm \] not really certain how I , \+ uh , I 'm not certain \[ that , \+ that \] it \] does a lot of good . I mean , that it \[ ends up , \+ ends up \] *-2 effectively , uh , uh , uh , avoiding a lot of the crimes that *T*-1 have capital \[ punishment \+ penalties . \] E_S
129982:13	you do n't think , N_S
129984:35	Yet , on the other hand , uh , I do n't know , E_S
129986:8	* seems like \[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's , \] \+ it 's \] the right thing 0 * to do *T*-1 . E_S
129987:15	Now , you know , I mean \[ somebody , \+ a \[ \[ s- , \+ s- , \] \+ serial \] killer or somebody \] goes in and machine guns , you know , \[ fifty , \+ fifty \] children in a school yard , E_S
129987:106	Now , you know , I mean \[ somebody , \+ a \[ \[ s- , \+ s- , \] \+ serial \] killer or somebody \] goes in and machine guns , you know , \[ fifty , \+ fifty \] children in a school yard , E_S
129989:13	I do n't know . E_S
129992:44	\[ I , \+ uh , I \] have the same dilemma , I think 0 *T*-1 .
129993:33	Uh , E_S \[ it 's , \+ you know , it \] seems right sometimes E_S
129993:44	Uh , E_S \[ it 's , \+ you know , it \] seems right sometimes E_S
129994:25	and then other times , you do n't know . E_S
130005:27	Uh , \[ I , \+ you know , I \] think 0 to a certain degree , the reason that \[ it , \+ it \] does n't serve as a deterrent *T*-1 , uh , may be because \[ y- , \+ you \] never know if it 's going *-2 to be \[ a- , \+ applied *-3 . \]
130005:38	Uh , \[ I , \+ you know , I \] think 0 to a certain degree , the reason that \[ it , \+ it \] does n't serve as a deterrent *T*-1 , uh , may be because \[ y- , \+ you \] never know if it 's going *-2 to be \[ a- , \+ applied *-3 . \]
130005:50	Uh , \[ I , \+ you know , I \] think 0 to a certain degree , the reason that \[ it , \+ it \] does n't serve as a deterrent *T*-1 , uh , may be because \[ y- , \+ you \] never know if it 's going *-2 to be \[ a- , \+ applied *-3 . \]
130005:112	Uh , \[ I , \+ you know , I \] think 0 to a certain degree , the reason that \[ it , \+ it \] does n't serve as a deterrent *T*-1 , uh , may be because \[ y- , \+ you \] never know if it 's going *-2 to be \[ a- , \+ applied *-3 . \]
130005:143	Uh , \[ I , \+ you know , I \] think 0 to a certain degree , the reason that \[ it , \+ it \] does n't serve as a deterrent *T*-1 , uh , may be because \[ y- , \+ you \] never know if it 's going *-2 to be \[ a- , \+ applied *-3 . \]
130012:10	and everybody knows exactly \[ what , \+ what \] for *T*-1 . E_S
130016:26	Uh , \[ and , \+ you know , and \] here , with our court system \[ and , \+ and \] ways of * sort of screwing it around and stuff \[ you can , \+ you can \] kind of always count on the fact , N_S
130020:20	And also , it does n't seem like it does that many harm , E_S
130021:15	I mean , sure , their life is taken *-1 , E_S
130023:10	so I think 0 sometimes they 'd prefer *-1 just to get it over with E_S
130028:80	so it 's more of the easy way out than * making them pay \[ for the con- , for \[ the \+ you know , what they 've done *T*-1 . \] \] E_S
130041:15	Uh , you know , and it 's \[ sort of a \+ , sort of a \] crass perspective on the usage of capital punishment , E_S
130045:34	but on the other hand , uh , uh , you know , \[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] know if \[ \[ it 's \+ that is , \] \+ that is \] that serious that they 're really never going *-1 to be out of jail ,
130045:68	but on the other hand , uh , uh , you know , \[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] know if \[ \[ it 's \+ that is , \] \+ that is \] that serious that they 're really never going *-1 to be out of jail ,
130055:8	it seems \[ by , \+ that by , \] N_S
130056:13	I do n't know , E_S
130059:13	Oh , I know , E_S
130071:19	\[ \[ I do n't know , \+
130072:49	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't , \] \+ I really do n't know , \]
130107:8	I think 0 it was outlawed *-1 for a while , \[ but , \+ \] uh , by the supreme court , I mean , or , the interpretation of the constitution E_S
130108:10	and it seems like everybody stopped E_S
130125:13	I do n't know if you 've ever , N_S
130126:11	I 'm sure 0 you 're familiar with it , E_S
130145:72	but on the other hand \[ it 's , \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] fairly impressive * to watch them , you know , walk into the room with gallows . E_S
130149:8	I think 0 they 're there , E_S
130150:8	I think that capital punishment \[ is , \+ is , \] uh , \[ in t- , \+ in Utah \] also . E_S
130161:24	\[ So , \+ but \] I think 0 they d- , N_S
130162:70	a long time ago , \[ I , \+ I \] remember 0 *T*-2 my dad was telling me this , I think 0 *T*-3 , that , uh , they do it by , like , a bunch of men 0 *T*-1 have guns E_S
130169:15	So they do n't know who *T*-1 killed , N_S
130177:23	\[ I , \+ I \] certainly would n't want *-1 to be the executioner , E_S
130178:8	I know that . E_S
130183:97	I 've always said that \[ if I , \+ if I \] had * to kill and clean and do \[ my own , \+ my own \] meat , I think 0 I 'd become a vegetarian . E_S
130185:8	I know . E_S
130187:47	As long as you 're sort of safely removed from it , it \[ seems , \+ seems \] not \[ so , \+ so \] bad , I guess 0 *T*-1 . E_S
130187:55	As long as you 're sort of safely removed from it , it \[ seems , \+ seems \] not \[ so , \+ so \] bad , I guess 0 *T*-1 . E_S
130208:7	so probably a economic size car or , uh , N_S
130225:10	you know , a nice car , American made N_S
130226:19	and , uh , you know , \[ a , \+ a \] nice car , but not too expensive , N_S
130235:60	While we 're talking , my next car , I 'd like *T*-1 to be sporty and , you know nice , E_S
130239:14	but , you know , it 's expensive E_S
130243:13	Oh , I know . E_S
130257:22	and , uh , I 'm not sure *ICH*-2 really how much I pay *T*-1 . E_S
130259:29	my mom 's helping me out , you know , because \[ I 'm a college , \+ I 'm in college \] E_S
130366:21	Uh , I have n't really thought about it . E_S
130368:24	I mean , I do n't know the names and stuff , E_S
130369:83	but if I were *-1 to go to a car lot and like look at them I would pick out one that *T*-2 , you know looked really nice . E_S
130380:30	Probably blue . Like if it , you know , was just an average , middle class car . E_S
130384:36	But if I were *-1 to get a sports car , maybe white or red . E_S
130397:16	Eighty-three , E_S I think *T*-1 . E_S
130428:16	Oh , I 'm sure , E_S
130459:21	It 's like , you know , N_S everybody freaks out when it sn- , N_S
130469:53	\[ She is , \+ \[ her , \+ uh , her \] family , you know , lives \] there , E_S

130552:17	But I , you know , drove a tractor , helped them weed beets and that sort of thing . E_S
130586:10	so that might be fun . E_S
130590:16	Cooking class , you know , E_S
130599:14	Museums , you know , E_S
130608:13	I do n't think 0 I went to any of them . E_S
130661:10	and I think 0 that 's all 0 they have *T*-1 . E_S
130694:51	I 'm going *-1 to try *-2 pressing one again * to make * sure that I pressed it hard enough because ,
130714:8	you probably get charged *-1 like a nickel or something like that . E_S
130735:94	Really what *T*-1 happens is 0 we just get a penny a can back \[ off the , \+ off the \] price , if you want *-2 to think of it that way . E_S
130747:77	Like we can recycle , uh , clear glass , brown glass , green glass . Uh , and milk jugs and , uh , newspapers , you know , E_S
130764:15	Well , shoot , maybe what we ought *-1 to do *T*-2 is *-1 start *-3 sending unsmashed , uh , Pepsi cans and whatever up there . E_S
130779:177	\[ what , \+ what \] *T*-1 really works , uh , at least down here is , \[ if there is , \+ if there is \] \[ some , e- , \+ even some \] money 0 * basically to take care of the gas 0 * to recycle it *T*-4 *T*-5 , you know what I mean *T*-2 , then people tend *-3 to do it .
130789:140	but if it 's going *-1 to cost you *-2 to take care of the environment , they 're not quite as , uh likely *-3 to do it as \[ if , \+ uh , if \] you get something back for it . You know . E_S
130800:33	\[ And , \+ uh , so , \] you know , if there are some energy savings or if there is some significant savings , anything that they can pass *T*-1 on to the consumer , you know ,
130800:117	\[ And , \+ uh , so , \] you know , if there are some energy savings or if there is some significant savings , anything that they can pass *T*-1 on to the consumer , you know ,
130801:48	it kind of reminds me of *-2 using an A T M card , you know , *-3 to get money or * doing your banking . E_S
130808:10	You know , if it 's free , people will use it , E_S
130814:9	You know . E_S
130815:17	But , uh , I know 0 we had a problem down here with , uh , \[ oil , \+ people taking oil \] out of their cars and just putting it down \[ \[ the d- , \+ you know , the s- , \] \+ the drain sewer . \] E_S
130815:125	But , uh , I know 0 we had a problem down here with , uh , \[ oil , \+ people taking oil \] out of their cars and just putting it down \[ \[ the d- , \+ you know , the s- , \] \+ the drain sewer . \] E_S
130823:27	apparently a lot of people , you know , every time 0 they change the oil *T*-1 , E_S they just dump all \[ the res- , \+ \] their old oil down there . E_S
130830:24	Uh , another thing 0 I thought of *T*-1 , I guess , 0 *-3 to recycle *T*-2 would be like clothes , because I mean everybody gets rid *-4 of their clothes sometime or other . E_S
130835:19	And that way , you know , you do n't get near enough \[ as , \+ as \] much as you bought it for *?* , E_S
130846:37	so that 's something that I had n't , you know , looked into *T*-1 before . E_S
130850:8	I know 0 a lot of places , they , uh , uh , N_S
130890:8	You probably have enjoyed *-1 getting away from the snow . E_S
130911:22	But , uh , I do n't know , E_S
130912:13	I 'm not sure 0 I would want *-1 to take on those winters . E_S
130913:29	I 'm getting older and , uh , not sure that 's something 0 I want *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S
130915:8	I know . E_S
130925:23	\[ I , \+ I \] probably do know , E_S
130925:29	\[ I , \+ I \] probably do know , E_S
130929:15	but I do n't know it by that name . E_S
130942:8	I know that area . E_S
130948:59	so , uh my particular area , the homes run anywhere from about sixty-five , eighty thousand dollars on up to probably half a million . E_S
130974:47	I mean , we 've got houses two streets away that *T*-1 are probably around seventy , eighty thousand E_S
130979:37	so \[ I do n't \+ I do n't \] even know how high those go *T*-1 , E_S
131026:54	And , so , some were vacant for quite a while before \[ they , \+ you know , they \] finally sold them because there were so many . E_S
131042:28	So \[ we just , \+ you know , we \] bargained *-1 to get an extra warrantee on that . E_S
131047:14	and , you know , we had originally thought 0 we 'd have *-1 to get a fix up special or something because *-2 being from the northeast we figured 0 we could n't afford anything . E_S
131047:28	and , you know , we had originally thought 0 we 'd have *-1 to get a fix up special or something because *-2 being from the northeast we figured 0 we could n't afford anything . E_S
131054:66	Between , we put in our own sprinkler system E_S and I just finished *-1 repainting the exterior and , you know , making drapes and buying furniture , E_S it 's just a money pit .
131071:15	And I 'm not sure what *T*-1 happened , E_S
131072:13	but I do know 0 the folks that we bought it from *T*-1 had done virtually no maintenance \[ for , \+ for \] about four years . E_S
131086:8	I think 0 that *ICH*-1 has been a major change and also the fact that , uh , there are so \[ mu- , \+ many \] more women *ICH*-2 in the work force nowadays than there were *?* E_S
131087:13	and that 's probably going *-1 to increase . You know . E_S
131087:36	and that 's probably going *-1 to increase . You know . E_S
131096:20	It increases each year I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
131098:8	It sure does . E_S
131102:15	Well , and I think 0 women have kind of had , uh , in the past the real subservient role . E_S
131117:22	but , uh , uh , I think 0 it 's not as much as it was *?* . E_S
131124:32	\[ I , \+ And especially , I \] think 0 *T*-3 with women increasingly working , they 're going *-1 to have *-2 to demand more from men . E_S
131137:15	Well , you know , they 've been talking about N_S
131138:15	and I do n't know , uh , what the status *ICH*-1 is *T*-2 on it , E_S
131139:14	but , you know , women get maternity leave and stuff like that E_S
131140:10	and I know that \[ they 've , \+ there \] has been discussion about men also getting maternity leave *-1 to help out , E_S
131144:12	but you know , I have n't really heard much about that recently . E_S
131146:15	Well , you know , there is a lot of companies that *T*-1 wo n't give \[ mat- , \+ women maternity \] leave for that very reason . E_S
131150:21	Uh , in fact , I know 0 the school districts down here , \[ you , \+ they \] do n't have maternity leave . E_S
131161:15	And I do n't know , uh , if bigger company companies do , E_S
131164:11	because they thought was showing prejisim to women and not to men E_S
131192:8	I think that we 're probably going *-1 to see a lot more companies , uh , run * by females . E_S
131192:21	I think that we 're probably going *-1 to see a lot more companies , uh , run * by females . E_S
131208:7	and probably , uh , we 'll see more females in political roles . E_S
131209:19	More governors and , I think , you know , roles like that . E_S
131209:29	More governors and , I think , you know , roles like that . E_S
131218:17	And we had a female mayor here in Dallas , E_S
131220:29	\[ and , \+ uh , so \] I think 0 we 're probably going *-1 to see more of that in the future . E_S
131220:42	\[ and , \+ uh , so \] I think 0 we 're probably going *-1 to see more of that in the future . E_S
131225:8	I think 0 that 's probably good . E_S
131225:21	I think 0 that 's probably good . E_S
131230:14	And , uh , maybe not so much that we sit on the back burners E_S
131233:15	Right , you know , E_S
131236:8	I think , N_S
131244:26	there are issues that , you know , as far as , like , equal pay for men and women and that kind of stuff , I totally am for *T*-1 . E_S
131248:61	But , I do n't get into \[ the , \+ uh , the \] real women libber movement , you know . E_S
131254:13	I do n't think 0 they 're ever going *-1 to prove that men and women are equal . E_S
131263:69	And , uh , I 'm not capable of *-2 lifting what , uh , a man can lift *T*-1 and you know , \[ that type of , \+ that type of \] thing , E_S
131271:13	and they 're probably , N_S
131272:11	I 'm sure , 0 in Dallas since you 're big places , a lot more women are , uh , working right out of their home with their P C 's or with their lap computers or whatever . E_S
131276:49	Uh , I have n't really talked to anybody that *T*-1 's , you know , too involved with that . E_S
131277:22	But , I mean , I think 0 that is a , N_S
131279:8	I think 0 that , N_S
131287:13	uh , I think 0 it 's wonderful . E_S
131303:17	and some ways , it might be kind of scary . E_S
131320:15	but then you know , there is the process of selection . E_S
131325:19	and , uh , You know , when you shop *T*-1 , you usually compare the prices E_S
131343:18	Oh , I did n't know that . E_S
131375:31	because \[ they do n't want * to know , \+ they almost do n't want *-1 to know \] us . E_S
131375:60	because \[ they do n't want * to know , \+ they almost do n't want *-1 to know \] us . E_S
131383:24	and the other two , I 'm not sure . E_S
131384:60	Well , \[ \[ Two s- , \+ two , \] \+ two , \] uh , uh , for sure are single . E_S
131405:62	\[ and \+ and \] a lot of times \[ they , \+ they 've \] got , you know , uh ,

131421:24	\[ And , \+ and \] you know what ? E_S
131427:8	I know . E_S
131433:9	You know ,
131442:34	and if they force them to *?* , you know that 's not good either . E_S
131458:15	Uh , you know , well , we 're talking like north Texas . E_S
131524:69	Oh , they do . Especially \[ if they , \+ if they 're \] meant *-1 to *?* , I think 0 *T*-2 . E_S
131529:13	Well , I certainly hope so . E_S
131544:35	Especially in some of these schools around here , I think 0 they have about twenty percent older students . E_S
131550:48	I 've seen some people that *T*-1 are really quite up there you know
131556:17	why not , you know . E_S
131566:8	I believe that , uh , we in that category , N_S
131579:23	I mean , I do n't know why I even went to college when I was seventeen *T*-2 *T*-1 . E_S
131588:8	we know what we 're wanting *-1 \[ to , \+ to , \] uh , study *T*-2 E_S
131589:15	and , uh we know our limitations . E_S
131614:8	We know what we can do *T*-1 . E_S
131649:90	and between a person 's religion , uh , \[ their , \+ their \] faith in their maker \[ w- , \+ \] \[ whether , \+ you know , uh , whether \] you 're Christian or Jewish or whatever , uh , N_S
131661:47	and , of course , Judeo-Christianity , uh , and of the Jewish folks , too , believe that the family unit is the one that *T*-1 was given *-2 the , uh , uh , mission by the Lord * to do this very thing . E_S
131670:11	I firmly believe that , uh , E_S
131674:9	I think golf , is n't it *?* ? E_S
131688:13	\[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 I played better golf *ICH*-3 when I was fifteen *T*-1 , John , than I play *?* right now . E_S

131690:13	\[ I know 0 I , \+ Oh , I know 0 I \] did , E_S
131690:36	\[ I know 0 I , \+ Oh , I know 0 I \] did , E_S
131693:8	I know 0 I did . E_S
131697:13	Course , I know 0 I watch my thirteen year old play now , you know , E_S
131697:49	Course , I know 0 I watch my thirteen year old play now , you know , E_S
131700:13	Oh , I know , E_S

131715:123	\[ And my mother who *T*-1 is now , \+ \[ he 's , \+ my stepfather is \] dead , but my mother who *T*-2 is now seventy-one , \] I can remember her being , I believe *RNR*-4 a sixteen *RNR*-3 or a fourteen *RNR*-3 handicap , E_S
131740:59	Fact , ever time 0 I 'd start *-1 trying *-2 to correct something *T*-3 , it seemed like the score would \[ go , \+ go \] back up , E_S
131745:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 I need *-1 to , uh , N_S
131749:8	I probably need *-1 to take \[ some , \+ some \] more lessons , uh , more current \[ and , \+ uh , and \] practice more often . E_S
131755:8	I think 0 I 'm probably the same way . E_S
131755:21	I think 0 I 'm probably the same way . E_S
131757:8	I know 0 ever year we buy , N_S
131770:68	and we always buy this weekend \[ at a , \+ at a \] country club in the hill country . You know , at , uh , Horseshoe Bay . E_S

131784:23	if you play regular , I think 0 *T*-1 it makes a big difference . E_S
131813:51	and , that 's something 0 my stepfather never could teach me *T*-1 , you know , * just to relax and hit the ball , E_S
131814:14	and , you know , so , subsequently when I do tire out from *-1 playing like twelve , fourteen holes *T*-2 , \[ my , \+ you know , a lot of my \] energy 's gone , E_S

131843:8	I think 0 this next year , \[ I 'm going *-1 to , \+ I 'm going *-2 to \] attempt *-3 to play more E_S
131852:51	and \[ I , \+ and I \] guess control my irons , better , you know , E_S
131859:24	\[ so , \+ but \] I think 0 the key is 0 \[ you just need *-1 to , \+ you need *-2 to \] play more often than I play . E_S
131867:13	Uh , I think 0 there is less \[ flus- , \+ frustration \] factor there , too , uh , E_S
131872:33	the one iron is something 0 I 've been thinking because my driver 's gone so badly lately that \[ I , \+ I \] should pick *T*-2 one up and try *-1 to start . E_S
131895:59	if I get off the tee box \[ and I , \+ and I 've , \] you know , you know , anything from a hundred fifty to two hundred yard drive through a straight , I just want *-1 to get down and kiss the ground , you know . E_S

131968:79	* Put a little bitty portable computer *ICH*-1 in there and a plasma display . And make it look like things like , uh , you know , attack simulators \[ and \+ MUMBLEx , and \] all sorts of little things 0 you 'd want *-2 to put your finger on the screen for *T*-3 . E_S

132138:22	That was n't alive for but maybe two years . E_S
132141:13	Well , I thought 0 was funny that they kept *-1 pushing the three eighty-six S X even though \[ the , \+ the \] price difference is about ten dollars . E_S
132156:14	what do you think *T*-1 about , uh , the self insurance business ? E_S
132170:13	and there 's probably some truth to that . E_S
132171:8	I think that , uh , generally I do n't welcome added government responsibilities . E_S
132173:10	and I think the costs and \[ the , \+ uh , the \] way 0 the medical profession has , every year N_S
132176:10	and I think eventually 0 the number of people that *T*-1 can afford health insurance , \[ as , \+ as \] it is now getting squeezed *-2 and squeezed *-2 tighter . N_S

132186:19	That 's where I think 0 most of the cost is coming *T*-1 . E_S
132188:28	Well , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 a lot of it is , uh *?* , E_S
132199:18	I mean , he knows knee problems okay , E_S
132203:30	I mean if anyone does , this guy knows it . E_S
132205:22	he says , well , I think 0 this is what it is *T*-1 , E_S

132223:38	I said to her , well , * look , you know ,

132227:13	I do n't know what it is *T*-1 , E_S
132234:10	You know , the costs are not , N_S
132236:46	It should n't cost more than thirty-five bucks for something like that , you know , reasonableness . E_S
132245:10	You know . E_S
132249:19	If the doctor makes a mistake , he can be sure that he 's going *-1 to be hauled *-2 into court . E_S
132249:33	If the doctor makes a mistake , he can be sure that he 's going *-1 to be hauled *-2 into court . E_S

132255:10	You know , uh , I was on a jury E_S
132270:20	I mean , you know , five million bucks is n't going *-1 to bring this kid back , you know , E_S

132272:15	Uh , you know , if the doctor is wrong , you know , he should be pulled *-1 from his license , E_S
132272:32	Uh , you know , if the doctor is wrong , you know , he should be pulled *-1 from his license , E_S
132272:42	Uh , you know , if the doctor is wrong , you know , he should be pulled *-1 from his license , E_S
132274:39	and away he goes because insurance pays for it , you know , E_S
132391:10	You know , there is motivation around there E_S
132399:20	And until then , you know I have belonged to exercise clubs E_S
132400:62	and oh I have gone to , uh , oh , like , uh , oh , these gyms , you know \[ that the , \+ \] like in Plano and Richardson \[ and , \+ \] uh , \[ where they offer the , uh , rec centers really \+ where they offer aerobics *T*-1 \] E_S
132424:13	Well , I know , 0 some people go during lunch , E_S

132440:13	I do n't think so . E_S
132446:10	You know , cause they know 0 we are in the building and coming . Where as , at , uh , another place , you are paying a lot more money E_S
132446:22	You know , cause they know 0 we are in the building and coming . Where as , at , uh , another place , you are paying a lot more money E_S
132477:14	That is for sure . E_S
132483:8	I know . E_S
132511:33	and \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] probably about a hundred and fifty dollars a year . Which *T*-1 is bad . E_S
132515:37	But , \[ I , \+ uh , I \] do n't know E_S

132536:8	You think 0 you 're getting your money 's worth ? E_S
132543:16	Well , that 's probably the next year 's agenda . E_S
132547:8	I sure hope 0 they do n't pass something like that . E_S
132551:26	and \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 one way or the other , we 're going *-1 to pay for the bureaucracy , I guess 0 *T*-2 . E_S
132552:58	Uh , it 's one area that *T*-1 is really , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 *T*-2 hurting the economy more than anything . E_S
132553:8	I think 0 the taxes \[ have just , \+ every time 0 you turn around *T*-1 \[ they , \+ they \] have \] taking more bite out of the dollars that *T*-2 are available for spending for any kind of products , E_S
132554:40	and \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] think 0 that is probably as big a item fueling the recession as anything right now . E_S
132554:53	and \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] think 0 that is probably as big a item fueling the recession as anything right now . E_S
132557:31	I remember 0 every time , 0 it seems like , we turned around *T*-1 , they 're adding another nickel or a few more cents onto the price of gasoline . E_S
132570:15	even , you know , \[ they , \+ they \] tax food . E_S
132573:13	Well , I think \[ that , \+ uh , that \] the problem with the sales tax , of course , is 0 it 's an unfair tax across the board , uh , as far as ability * to pay , which \[ \[ a- , \+ allegedly , \] \+ allegedly \] taxes are supposed *-1 to be directed *-2 towards *T*-3 . E_S
132574:55	But , uh , now people with the lowest income pay a hundred percent almost of , you know , taxes on everything 0 they buy *T*-1 ,
132575:28	and where people that make , you know , two hundred , three hundred thousand dollars a year *T*-3 , certainly a portion of that , they are n't going *-4 to be paying taxes on *T*-5 , you know . E_S

132592:17	but , uh , I think 0 taxes generally are unfair E_S
132595:29	\[ Wha- , \+ what \] do you think *T*-1 of that new luxury car tax , anything over ten \[ thou- , \+ or thirty thousand \] dollars ? E_S
132597:15	Well , you know , like other things , if they do n't affect you , you do n't worry about them too much . E_S
132602:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think , uh , you know , 0 generally the prices of cars have gotten out of line , which *T*-1 is , uh , you know . N_S

132604:10	Oh , sure . E_S
132606:97	And , uh , I guess 0 if people got thirty , forty thousand bucks 0 * to spend *T*-1 on a car , uh , that 's their prerogative , you know . E_S

132620:45	And the idea of that kind of taxation is * to have people think twice on * putting their money into that , I guess 0 *T*-1 , you know , unless they really want it ,

132622:79	well , \[ it , \+ it 's \] just like * having taxes on *RNR*-1 , or exemptions for *RNR*-1 kids , you know . E_S

132637:63	but if you look on all interest things , not just credit cards , but on your cars and , you know , \[ a- , \+ any \] kind of interest that you 're paying *T*-1 , from a personal point of view , that might make certain sense in * stimulating consumer purchasers . E_S

132716:204	and then you just dip the carcass in , uh , boiling water , pull it out , and \[ there 's a , \+ we use a \] little raspy brush , 0 *T*-1 pulls the hair off , and , uh , gut it , and , uh , just stick it down in a pit with some cloves and , uh , some pineapple , about three pineapples , you know , * sliced them up , and , uh , cover him up with , uh , wet , uh , sacks , feed sacks is what I usually use *T*-2 and then start a charcoal fire on top of him . E_S
132733:20	I mean , you know , uh , it has a lot less fat . E_S
132737:15	This wild boar weighed probably about three hundred and thirty pounds E_S
132745:15	Well , you know , we took the skin and the head \[ and the le- , \+ and the feet \] off , E_S
132746:25	and that was about , you know , a \[ hundred , \+ hundred \] pounds of just ham . E_S
132750:36	Oh , well , \[ we 're , \+ you know , we 're \] not going *-1 to eat the whole thing . E_S
132756:19	But , uh , you know , we 're going *-1 to drive up to Kansas City , see my wife 's folks , E_S

133066:14	but , you know , we really debated at the beginning , E_S

133150:13	I 'm not certain , E_S

133184:45	I mean , that 's exactly what it is *T*-1 , you know , E_S
133185:82	\[ it 's just a , \+ it 's a \] cheap \[ little \+ little \] car 0 * just to go , you know , * run around town in *T*-1 E_S

133231:11	It 's probably , um ,
133233:5	maybe a little smaller . E_S
133237:57	I talked to someone that * was only a couple of thousand in her town , I think 0 *T*-2 *T*-1 . E_S
133244:8	I thought 0 maybe it was you . E_S
133244:15	I thought 0 maybe it was you . E_S
133248:8	I certainly have some ideas since I 'm studying it now in college . E_S
133258:18	Um , I do n't know , E_S
133259:27	\[ I 'm pretty , \+ I think 0 I 'm pretty \] satisfied with , um , N_S
133273:14	that 's for sure . E_S
133283:13	Something is definitely wrong . E_S
133293:15	so I do n't know how they expect them to , uh , pass history *T*-2 when they ca n't read anything , you know , even read a word problem in math *T*-1 . E_S

133301:38	So \[ do you , \+ what *ICH*-2 do you \] think 0 *T*-1 is good about the schools ? E_S
133310:25	There 's no national curriculum , you know , E_S
133311:48	I mean , what they 'd be teaching *T*-1 in an Arlington school they may not be teaching *T*-2 in a Plano school E_S
133315:29	and in the same school district , \[ you may , \+ even in an Arlington seventh grade for instance , you may \] have an English class E_S
133315:63	and in the same school district , \[ you may , \+ even in an Arlington seventh grade for instance , you may \] have an English class E_S
133316:8	you may have half literature for the whole year , E_S
133322:36	So \[ that 's kind of o- , \+ you know , that 's kind of odd \] to me . E_S
133340:19	and , uh , you know , where our kids might be in a great school *T*-1 , we 're still paying an awful lot of taxes for people who *T*-2 are on welfare and unemployment because they ca n't read , you know . E_S

133348:13	I do n't know . E_S
133350:19	and I had never even thought of it . E_S
133351:22	Actually it makes sense to a certain extent , E_S
133352:139	because sometimes , like a third grade teacher will get kids from second grade that *T*-1 did n't even learn what , uh , N_S they should *?* *T*-2 *-3 to do the work that she is supposed *-4 to teach *T*-5 , you know . MUMBLEx and according to her plan , E_S
133356:51	so I guess 0 if there was a national curriculum we 'd at least have a certain amount that all kids would learn *T*-1 . E_S
133360:69	But , uh . We actually rank *-1 forty-ninth in the world as far as just plain literacy goes *?* , you know . E_S

133373:13	I do n't know . E_S
133375:10	so I probably ca n't *?* . E_S
133378:13	But I do think that we have *-1 to cut out some of this folderol stuff and go back in the first five , six grades and just keep *-2 going over and over and over until most of those that *T*-3 are capable can at least learn *-4 to read and write E_S
133381:63	because they ca n't even get the menial job without *-1 being able *-2 to read something nowadays you know . E_S
133385:103	Uh , \[ you ca n't , \+ you ca n't \] even work an answering machine if you 're at work and had *-1 to get a message or something , you know , or fill out an application * to work at McDonalds if you ca n't read . E_S
133389:17	So , uh , I think 0 \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] a start at least , * going back to the basics in the early grades E_S
133397:8	I believe that . E_S
133408:8	You think about AIDS research ? E_S

133477:33	\[ I , \+ um , I \] do n't know , E_S

134836:11	you never know . E_S
134849:8	I think 0 we went through him though *-1 to get to Gorbachev on a lot of subjects E_S
134868:101	And , uh , right now we 're in \[ a , \+ uh , I guess 0 it 's *RNR*-2 either a \] zero lot line or a garden home . Which you might call it *T*-1 . E_S
134879:106	Uh , and it 's , uh , I guess 0 *T*-2 what they call *T*-1 a story and a half . E_S Because it 's not a full two story . Where , you know , everything on top is on bottom *T*-1 . E_S
134902:15	Well , you know , these guys that *T*-1 gambled high lost big you know . E_S
134902:51	Well , you know , these guys that *T*-1 gambled high lost big you know . E_S
134941:26	There 's still no work , you know . E_S
134945:19	So , uh , you know , I decided this summer that , uh , you know , we had enough credit on the credit cards *-1 to buy the materials E_S
134945:50	So , uh , you know , I decided this summer that , uh , you know , we had enough credit on the credit cards *-1 to buy the materials E_S
134954:13	I did n't know that . E_S
134977:27	\[ As , \+ as \] you know , anything that *T*-1 involves the government \[ is , \+ works \] half as well as it 's supposed *-2 to *?* costs three times as much .
134987:19	But , uh , you know , my home is , uh , fairly simple . E_S
134995:14	but , you know , I like *-1 to do stuff with my hands and whatnot , E_S
135024:14	but , you know , \[ he 's \+ \] N_S
135028:32	I can just make out his place , you know .
135056:45	But , in the house itself , I 've been working inside , you know , \[ these , \+ \[ lo- , \+ \] these \] many months E_S
135072:45	Well , as much as I could get *?* in it , you know .
135087:20	I mean , you know . There 's no place in the house where you can stand and not see four windows *T*-1 . E_S
135103:19	So the first , you know , N_S
135131:17	The , N_S you know ,
135137:14	But , you know , \[ I , \+ I \] see these magazines where , you know , dig \[ your , \+ your \] own deck *T*-1 . E_S

135182:26	Well , I 'm sure 0 you probably are *?* . E_S
135191:41	\[ \[ I , \+ I have , \] \+ you know , I inherited \] the genes that *T*-1 make me think 0 I 'm creative , but not the ones that *T*-2 give me the ability * to be *?* . E_S

135208:21	It is *?* , you know , N_S
135210:45	it 's just * being able *-1 to lay out the material and measure it because you need so much room . E_S
135212:5	Measure it and get it to , N_S
135227:36	So that , at least I can do *T*-2 , you know , *-1 watching T V or whatever E_S
135237:45	and \[ I 've , \+ I 've \] gone and , you know , put the needle through my thumb a few times , *-1 trying *-2 to get it through E_S
135258:17	Well , they 're probably easier than * keeping dogs , though , are n't they *?* . E_S
135267:10	and you probably have *-1 to clean out the tank too . E_S
135270:54	you do n't have *-1 to do as much \[ as , \+ as \] I thought . E_S
135277:42	and , \[ what , I 'm , \+ what I \] think now 0 *T*-1 is the reason is 0 I kept the tank too clean E_S
135291:41	And I would just take everything out and just like , you know , wash it with scalding hot water E_S
135298:50	And so you 'd have *-1 to start all over *-2 to build that up probably . E_S
135326:47	and then back at home I used *-1 to have a small , you know , five gallon tank . E_S
135350:14	But , you know . N_S
135356:21	I just have , you know , what they call *T*-1 community fish guppies , and platies \[ and , \+ and \] basic things . E_S
135368:16	Well , they 're probably \[ hardy , \+ harder \] 0 * to take care of *T*-1 E_S

135444:13	You would n't think that . E_S
135461:33	well , it makes you understand that , you know , things are different . E_S
135465:13	\[ We might , \+ right . We might \] decide what *T*-1 's proper and what *T*-2 is n't *?* , E_S

135466:12	but you know , that 's the way 0 it is *T*-1 for them . E_S
135485:18	well and then , you think , well , how did they do it *T*-2 out in the real world anyway when these fish are in the tropicals or wherever they are *T*-1 *-4 kind of trying *-5 to keep up with that *T*-3 , E_S
135512:16	Well , I never thought about that , E_S
135514:47	like I had a call *ICH*-1 the other day from Birmingham , Michigan you know , E_S
135518:18	\[ and I was thinking \+ yeah , and I was thinking \] N_S
135518:37	\[ and I was thinking \+ yeah , and I was thinking \] N_S
135522:24	the only Birmingham 0 I could think of *T*-1 was Alabama . E_S
135543:14	but , you know , sometimes biogr- , N_S
135550:12	because you know \[ that 's \+ it 's \] really and truly a true thing . E_S
135555:10	You know , I read one about Bob Hope that I liked *T*-1 . E_S
135562:31	if it 's not a heavy biography , you know I enjoy it . E_S
135568:74	\[ I , \+ when I \] was younger *T*-2 I read about every king and queen that *T*-1 lived , I think , in Europe . E_S
135571:21	I was trying *-1 to think , uh , N_S
135583:47	It was a lot of fun because they used these real names , you know . E_S
135585:45	* Wonder if it was by one of those famous writers , you know E_S
135589:14	in fact I believe 0 it was *?* E_S
135595:8	I believe . E_S
135600:8	I think 0 it was by her , now \+ that you mention it , because someone had given it to me , E_S
135601:10	and I thought , well , this will be great , E_S
135605:45	I 've heard that \[ she 's done real- , \+ you know , her books are really \] interesting , E_S
135612:42	Well , when you use real people like that *T*-1 , I think royalty , especially , you know . N_S
135612:61	Well , when you use real people like that *T*-1 , I think royalty , especially , you know . N_S
135618:8	I know , uh , 0 \[ the Bri- , \+ some of the British \] people laugh at us because we 're so enthralled with their royalty . E_S
135621:12	but you know , that 's like them being enthralled with our football and so forth , you know . E_S
135621:59	but you know , that 's like them being enthralled with our football and so forth , you know . E_S
135623:8	I know , E_S
135638:48	and , uh , it was , uh , one of those generation novels , you know E_S
135664:26	I stayed up one night , I think until two in the morning *-1 finishing one of hers because \[ I star- , \+ I could not put \] it down . E_S
135670:13	I do n't know , E_S
135672:8	I probably have missed the last few since I 've been back in school . E_S
135675:8	it seems like she does n't write as often as , oh , well , like Danielle Steele and those silly things . E_S
135682:105	I mean , if you 've read one , I mean \[ \[ it 's , \+ It , \] \+ it 's \] practically the same thing over and over , you know . E_S
135685:42	I 've never read a whole one of hers , I do n't think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
135688:10	And * think how rich she is *T*-1 . E_S
135691:19	would n't I , you know , N_S
135703:10	You know , mini series and so forth , E_S
135704:10	and it seems to me like Susan Howatch does not write as often . E_S
135708:61	and they 're \[ so \+ such \] a higher intellectual level , because she quotes a lot , you know . E_S
135713:8	I think 0 she does a lot of research , too . E_S
135721:14	I do n't think 0 they 've ever made a movie , do you *?* ? E_S
135724:13	I do n't think so , E_S
135729:10	You know , I , N_S
135732:14	I really just thought about it now E_S
135738:13	I do n't know . E_S
135741:65	Maybe they 're just too involved 0 for the average person to go and sit through *T*-1 them , you know . E_S
135747:21	they 're such , you know , N_S
135754:7	And maybe that turns people off , E_S
135755:34	but * look at GONE WITH THE WIND , you know . E_S
135757:13	Oh , I know . E_S
135770:41	in the beginning when it was \[ on , \+ you know , on \] route coming out *T*-1 I heard mixed publicity kind of good and bad , E_S
135780:10	Do you know anyone that *T*-1 's read it ? E_S
135789:8	I think 0 it was on the best-seller list , though for a while . E_S
135809:39	I have n't expected it to be colder until , you know N_S
135814:13	I do n't know . E_S
135823:40	so \[ \[ you , \+ you , \] \+ you \] probably go everywhere and have all sorts of weather . E_S
135849:8	I know 0 the systems have been real strong out . E_S
135985:15	Well , do you think 0 \[ this , \+ \[ the , \+ the \] \] weather is typical for this time of the year ? E_S
135990:15	I , you know , N_S
135992:68	the , um , uh , N_S we 've gotten a fair amount of rain for this time of year already I think 0 *T*-1 E_S
135999:84	and , uh , I 've been surprised *-1 that we have n't seen more of the temperatures that we 've got *T*-2 today , you know , that *T*-3 moved in last night . E_S
136012:10	and I thought , great E_S
136060:33	Well , and they 've had , uh , you know , N_S
136069:33	Well , \[ I , \+ it 's does n't seem like I \] get enough time 0 * to watch much T V *T*-1 , E_S
136075:8	I think 0 that 's kind of a good show . E_S
136084:33	and , um , MUMBLEx I 'm trying *-1 to think . E_S
136085:31	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't even know if I have any other real regular ones that I watch *T*-1 . E_S
136115:51	I just like *-1 to have the T V on \[ if , \+ you know , if \] I 'm home alone or something E_S
136132:33	\[ and \+ and so \] I 've have n't seemed *-1 to have gotten out as much , E_S
136150:54	I usually do if I 'm home for a couple of days , like , you know , around Christmas or whatever , E_S
136156:32	for a while I 'll ask people if they know what *T*-1 happened E_S
136170:10	and I maybe watched it for a week E_S
136174:17	but , um , I know that people used *-1 to arrange their whole schedules around the , you know , N_S
136174:60	but , um , I know that people used *-1 to arrange their whole schedules around the , you know , N_S
136192:38	but , yeah , oh , I was really trying *-1 to think . E_S
136193:16	I do n't even know if there 's any other shows that I watch *T*-1 or else . E_S
136240:8	I think 0 he has some interesting things on it . E_S
136242:8	I know , E_S
136255:13	I do n't know , E_S
136256:32	there 's some real weird people that , he seems *-1 to come up with *T*-2 . E_S
136260:53	Is n't it *EXP*-1 strange how people are fascinated *-2 by other people that they think 0 *T*-3 are strange *T*-4 ? E_S
136266:30	He does have some real bizarre things , I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
136271:29	So , other than that , I do n't know . E_S
136286:27	It snowed a little bit , um , probably about four days ago E_S
136317:25	I mean , I , you know , N_S
136345:12	but you know , the thing is that this happens , E_S
136354:17	So , I do n't know . E_S
136359:13	I do n't think 0 I would *?* . E_S
136382:35	Um , \[ I 've , \+ I 've \] probably talked maybe to five people . E_S
136382:41	Um , \[ I 've , \+ I 've \] probably talked maybe to five people . E_S
136418:62	It looks like I 'm going *-1 to have *-2 to get up there again , because we may have a leak . E_S
136422:28	We 've been getting quite a bit , maybe not quite as bad as some of the folks down around San Antonio , E_S
136432:14	But you 're probably , \[ what , \+ \] about halfway across the state from San Antonio , though , are n't you *?* ? E_S
136434:84	Well , \[ we 're up , \+ uh , we 're north \] and , uh , oh , about , uh , I do n't know , uh , eighty to a hundred miles south of the Oklahoma line , I guess 0 *T*-1 . E_S
136528:31	We 're just on a concrete slab , you know E_S
136553:47	Well , usually what you do *T*-1 is * just wait until you think 0 it 's stopped , E_S
136564:13	uh , I think , with , uh N_S
136574:13	I do n't know quite how that works *T*-1 . E_S
136576:16	I do n't really know . E_S
136581:8	I think 0 it is *?* . E_S
136592:8	I think 0 that 's the way 0 this is done *-1 *T*-2 . E_S
136603:50	well , the previous owner had a major problem with it , because , uh , oh probably a variety of things . E_S
136633:11	They 're probably at an age where they do n't want *-1 to spend any time with their parents *T*-2 . E_S
136643:34	I have a kind of a fortunate situation , I think 0 *T*-1 , right now with my sixteen year old . E_S
136650:25	They keep it open , you know , for kids to do their work E_S
136654:71	\[ and he , \+ um , and then \[ they , \+ the school district \] \] hires an aide , you know , 0 *T*-1 to work for me . E_S
136676:19	so I really do spend probably more time *ICH*-1 with him \[ than , \+ than \] most , you know . E_S
136676:65	so I really do spend probably more time *ICH*-1 with him \[ than , \+ than \] most , you know . E_S
136703:45	and every day that she 's not at school *T*-1 , uh , she thinks 0 we need *-2 to have someone over and play E_S
136717:8	I think , uh , 0 I find myself getting my little projects going and not taking the time that I should *?* *T*-1 . E_S
136740:45	But that 's kind of hard 0 * to do *T*-1 , you know . E_S
136749:53	Well , if you 're kind of a person that *T*-1 likes things , you know , organized or neat E_S
136753:14	or , you know E_S
136757:11	then I think 0 \[ it , \+ it \] is hard . E_S
136759:8	I think 0 one of the nice things about holidays is that , you know , it does give you the opportunity * to spend more time yeah , with family . E_S
136759:49	I think 0 one of the nice things about holidays is that , you know , it does give you the opportunity * to spend more time yeah , with family . E_S
136768:41	and it 's just really nice because we can do , you know , the things 0 you want *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S
136779:17	and , uh , I think 0 it 's going *-1 to be real quiet E_S
136794:21	\[ but , \+ you know , but \] every now and then , I mean , he 's got a lot of \[ those technic , \+ those hard kind , \] E_S you know ,
136794:103	\[ but , \+ you know , but \] every now and then , I mean , he 's got a lot of \[ those technic , \+ those hard kind , \] E_S you know ,
136814:52	and , um , then his sixteen year old brother started *-1 helping , too , you know . E_S
136817:10	you know , these are kind of things 0 like during the normal rat race N_S
136829:20	In fact in , I think 0 if people would learn *-1 to turn off the T V -s E_S
136835:8	I think 0 that 's a lot of the breakdown of the communication and the communication that *T*-1 would take place in a family , E_S
136846:66	and there 's always a few people in the family that , when they stare at it *T*-1 , you know , *T*-2 they 're totally turned off to everything else . E_S
136872:24	and I , huh , N_S you know ,
136873:30	how can you watch that *T*-1 , you know E_S
136879:13	I do n't know . E_S
136911:33	Um , the furthest 0 I drove *T*-1 was probably Texas , E_S
136943:36	Walt Disney World , and other places , it 's just the wrong time of the year 0 * to go *T*-1 . E_S
136960:8	I think 0 the scenery kind of , N_S
136977:14	Um , I think , uh , 0 the biggest limitation is a lot , just time and money , is n't it *?* . E_S
136990:31	you have *-1 to like crowds , you know . E_S
137005:13	I do n't think , uh , 0 hardly anybody lives there , E_S
137006:32	because it 's just kind of like , you know , tourists . E_S
137023:4	sure . E_S
137034:67	Oh , I like all the nature things 0 there are *T*-1 0 * to look at *T*-2 , you know . E_S
137037:18	well , and you can probably , N_S
137039:13	so you have probably a lot of green , and lot of real pretty things . E_S
137061:27	I have a little baby 0 *T*-1 thinks 0 he needs *-2 to cry now that I 'm on the phone . E_S
137079:8	I think , uh , 0 there 's a lot of places uh , oh , down , even in southern Utah , the \[ canyons , \+ canyon lands \] and Bryce Canyon E_S
137095:10	But I think 0 I 'm kind of a summer vacationer . E_S
137128:15	But I do n't know if that 's just kids , or if that 's , uh , N_S
137129:5	maybe those type of products \[ sh- , \+ should \] be for older kids . E_S
137138:22	And , uh , I do n't think 0 they 're unduly rough , E_S
137139:7	but maybe they are *?* . E_S
137140:13	I do n't know . E_S
137156:8	* seems to me \[ that \+ that \] became a craze when she was already , oh , like , you know , third , fourth , fifth grade *T*-1 . E_S
137156:72	* seems to me \[ that \+ that \] became a craze when she was already , oh , like , you know , third , fourth , fifth grade *T*-1 . E_S
137189:42	Well , \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ you know , those \] little arms are supposed *-1 to twist almost any way E_S
137194:70	\[ she 's not that strong , that I would \+ she 's not that big of a girl that I think 0 *T*-1 could \] really take a grip on it like a bigger kid could *?* , you know . E_S
137194:128	\[ she 's not that strong , that I would \+ she 's not that big of a girl that I think 0 *T*-1 could \] really take a grip on it like a bigger kid could *?* , you know . E_S
137207:10	You know , that was about it . E_S
137216:25	And the main thing 0 my kids seem *-1 to be into *T*-2 nowadays are electronics . E_S
137228:37	We , uh , have n't had that much , you know , problem with things that we have bought *T*-1 . E_S
137229:8	They seem *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] last . E_S
137237:17	And , uh , it seems like it 's just \[ a , \+ an \] added tack on . E_S
137238:33	Plus a lot of the credit cards now , you know , will guarantee , E_S
137239:30	if you purchase on your credit card you know , then they put an extended warranty on it if it does n't work or if you have a problem with it in a certain period of time , E_S
137239:103	if you purchase on your credit card you know , then they put an extended warranty on it if it does n't work or if you have a problem with it in a certain period of time , E_S
137244:10	so it seems like it 's a waste of money . E_S
137254:59	And like \[ I 've even bought , \+ on a recliner once I bought , \] you know , \[ \[ a , \+ a , \] \+ an \] extended warranty for cleaning and stuff like that , E_S
137259:13	And so it seems ridiculous . E_S
137276:8	I think 0 these extended warranties are gimmicks , really . E_S
137291:23	and you 're trying *-1 to think oh , maybe I 'll need this . E_S
137291:32	and you 're trying *-1 to think oh , maybe I 'll need this . E_S
137292:30	\[ You never , \+ you always \] think gosh , if I say no , then I wo n't , you know . E_S
137292:72	\[ You never , \+ you always \] think gosh , if I say no , then I wo n't , you know . E_S
137300:13	I do n't know . E_S
137303:30	and if it goes out , well you know . N_S
137305:8	You probably got your worth out of it anyway . E_S
137317:13	well , you probably are real careful of the brands 0 you buy *T*-1 E_S
137318:47	and \[ the , \+ \] when you do buy things *T*-1 , you probably watch what \[ kind of , \+ type of \] MUMBLEx . N_S
137386:17	So , I do n't know , E_S
137436:54	but that 's my first trip back in , oh , goodness , um , um , thirty years maybe . E_S
137488:8	They seem *-1 to be trailing out quickly . E_S
137511:13	I do n't know why I got stuck *-1 down here in Texas now *T*-2 . E_S
137514:8	I think 0 it 's called *-1 a job , E_S
137515:13	I do n't know . E_S
137529:41	\[ lot , \+ lot \] of concrete and glass , you know . E_S
137540:10	Uh , probably \[ the , \+ the \] last one that I went to California *T*-1 E_S
137618:24	They 've always been , you know , my favorite . E_S
137638:18	like just , you know , two years ago they were one and fifteen . E_S
137644:29	so everybody 's really going crazy , you know , down here . E_S
137650:14	but , you know , they have a lot of young exciting players now , uh , E_S
137651:33	I mean , everybody was real upset , you know , when they fired Tom Landry *T*-1 , E_S
137652:14	but , you know , now it 's like , you know , they 're doing good
137652:38	but , you know , now it 's like , you know , they 're doing good
137655:18	Uh , football fans are probably the most fickle people in the world . E_S
137659:36	* Hit a bad season E_S and it 's , you know , the coach 's fault , E_S
137664:27	First good season , the coach can do no wrong . E_S
137667:15	exactly . You know . E_S
137669:46	But \[ they \+ Dallas \] has always been good ahead , you know , * heading good players and both \[ running , \+ running \] backs \[ and , \+ and \] defense . E_S
137678:15	uh , you know , they have a young team . E_S
137679:18	It 's , you know , a lot different than the teams 0 they used *-1 to have *T*-2 where it 's the same old , you know , players *ICH*-3 every year and , you know , same coach , same everything *T*-4 , E_S
137679:91	It 's , you know , a lot different than the teams 0 they used *-1 to have *T*-2 where it 's the same old , you know , players *ICH*-3 every year and , you know , same coach , same everything *T*-4 , E_S

137680:25	so , now it 's , you know , like a taste of something different . E_S
137681:22	They 're all not , you know , mister nice guys like they used *-1 to be *?* . E_S
137684:24	Now it 's like , you know , tough and dirty team E_S
137691:12	but you know , we beat them already . E_S
137693:21	\[ so , \+ you know , so \] everybody has the feeling like we can go all the way to the Super Bowl , E_S
137694:14	but , you know , it 's just that we have *-1 to play every game away , you know , E_S
137694:63	but , you know , it 's just that we have *-1 to play every game away , you know , E_S
137701:14	but , you know , we should beat them . E_S
137705:13	Course , I think , you know , 0 you ca n't really go by what *T*-1 happened earlier in the season because teams jell together or they 've had injuries that *T*-2 heal E_S
137705:23	Course , I think , you know , 0 you ca n't really go by what *T*-1 happened earlier in the season because teams jell together or they 've had injuries that *T*-2 heal E_S
137712:19	\[ and , you know it can be a tot- , \+ or injuries that , uh , *T*-1 have newly happened and it could be almost a totally \] new team *ICH*-2 out there than the one 0 we played *T*-3 . E_S
137722:26	They 've won , like , I think 0 *T*-1 six or seven in a row now , E_S
137740:19	O U has always been known *-1 for their running game . E_S
137801:13	\[ I thought , \+ I thought \] 0 they would get beat *-1 today because , I mean they 're so young , you know , E_S

137801:84	\[ I thought , \+ I thought \] 0 they would get beat *-1 today because , I mean they 're so young , you know , E_S
137844:22	or somebody that *T*-1 's maybe got a Cadillac or Lincoln and Lexus dealership , uh E_S
137860:26	\[ and , \+ but \] the particular seems *-1 to be \[ the , \+ uh , the \] quiet ride . E_S
137897:30	it 's kind of a traction control , I think 0 they call it *?* . E_S
137902:8	I think 0 that 's already on most of them , E_S
137906:36	this is \[ a , \+ \] uh , Uh , probably suspension tied * into the brakes . E_S
137925:13	\[ Mississippi probably does n't , \+ Mississippi probably does n't \] have *-1 to worry too much . E_S
137925:29	\[ Mississippi probably does n't , \+ Mississippi probably does n't \] have *-1 to worry too much . E_S
137946:24	and the first winter down here was probably the worst winter 0 they 'd seen *T*-1 in twenty years , E_S
137949:13	Oh , I know . E_S
137962:19	and the moon roof I think 0 *T*-1 is also an option . E_S
137993:86	And , \] uh , the dealership 0 I dealt with *T*-1 , they order them all with the , uh , moon roof and , uh you know , nice floor mats and everything in there . E_S
138039:15	the Lincoln ride is certainly good , too ,
138058:22	uh , so what do you think *T*-1 about the school system ? E_S
138060:13	Well , I think 0 \[ they 're , \+ they 're \] having a lot of trouble right now . E_S
138061:8	I know 0 my son goes to a private school , E_S
138062:17	but , uh , I think 0 \[ they 're , \+ big city public schools by definition are \] having \[ a , \+ a \] tough time right now \[ just from , \+ uh , probably from \] budget cuts \[ and , \+ and \] everything else going on . E_S
138062:111	but , uh , I think 0 \[ they 're , \+ big city public schools by definition are \] having \[ a , \+ a \] tough time right now \[ just from , \+ uh , probably from \] budget cuts \[ and , \+ and \] everything else going on . E_S
138093:13	so it 's maybe a hundred per grade . E_S
138100:29	* Kind of gives them the , you know , N_S
138122:18	And I just did n't think 0 that was going *-1 get it . E_S
138123:8	I thought 0 he needed *-1 to be exposed *-2 to a situation where he could push ahead , uh , every day . But yet still be with his peers age wise *T*-3 . E_S
138132:24	Uh , one thing 0 I think 0 I 've noticed *T*-1 is , uh ,
138143:17	but , uh , * seems to me that , uh , kids these days , uh , can really get away with murder E_S
138148:8	I know . E_S
138151:55	And , uh , * *EXP*-2 makes me a little nervous that , uh , students do n't seem *-1 to show that respect E_S
138156:16	We would n't have thought of *-1 crossing a teacher when we were in school *T*-2 . E_S
138164:16	* Would n't have thought of it E_S
138172:97	And , uh , the things 0 they can say and do *T*-1 to a teacher \[ and \+ \] they do from what I understand *T*-2 , uh , E_S I think 0 that 's wrong . E_S
138172:110	And , uh , the things 0 they can say and do *T*-1 to a teacher \[ and \+ \] they do from what I understand *T*-2 , uh , E_S I think 0 that 's wrong . E_S
138173:8	I think 0 we need *-1 to get back to \[ the , \+ \] * show some respect E_S
138179:32	\[ have not , \+ uh , I do n't think 0 * have , had \] that basic upbringing in a lot of cases E_S
138191:19	Well , how do you think that that 's happened *T*-1 ? E_S
138192:8	You think 0 our society 's just , uh , stopped *-1 talking out , E_S
138205:15	so life is not maybe as simple as it was *?* at one time , E_S
138206:29	\[ but , \+ but \] still , I think 0 it goes back to a commitment by the parents *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] teach , uh , basic values and basic , uh , respectful \[ of , \+ uh , -ness \] of authority . E_S
138210:18	And I just do n't think that this does n't always get emphasized *-1 anymore , uh , E_S
138249:10	so I think that maybe that 's effected it to some degree . E_S
138249:17	so I think that maybe that 's effected it to some degree . E_S
138254:8	I think 0 that probably does \[ have , \+ have \] something 0 *T*-1 to do with it , E_S
138254:18	I think 0 that probably does \[ have , \+ have \] something 0 *T*-1 to do with it , E_S
138285:44	and I do it out of hobby more than , uh , you know , something 0 I have *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S
138288:28	Uh , well , I like *-1 to think of it as a hobby ,
138308:15	I , you know , N_S
138311:31	but also \[ I , \+ I \] sometimes think that , uh , I enjoy *-1 doing that E_S
138314:10	Do you think 0 you would be able *-1 to do some more if you had more tools and different tools ? E_S
138383:25	Uh , it \[ t- , \+ seems to \] me 0 the radial arm saw \[ is , \+ is \] better , E_S
138393:31	Whereas if you 're ripping wood , you 're probably better off with \[ a , \+ a \] table saw . E_S
138428:99	lot of the equipment *ICH*-2 , too , that \[ I 've , \+ I 've \] used *T*-1 in the past , uh , \[ I w- , \+ you know , I 've \] used *T*-3 in school E_S
138430:13	I do n't know , E_S
138431:246	\[ I 'd , \+ I 'd \] kind of like *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] look at equipment like a lathe or like you say , a table saw and some of those things that *T*-2 would make , uh , some pretty nice , uh , pieces of , uh , well , wood , \[ for , \+ for \] different things for tables , \[ for , \+ for , \] uh , chairs , for , you know , decks and so forth E_S
138432:17	so , I do n't know , E_S
138437:10	and I think 0 \[ the , \+ the \] main thing is , like you say , 0 \[ it 's a , \+ it 's a \] good out . E_S
138438:45	It 's an opportunity * to get out and relieve some of the pressure that you feel *T*-1 day to day E_S
138449:24	So , uh , what do you think *T*-1 about child care . E_S
138452:8	You know ? E_S
138465:39	Well , too many kids \[ and , \+ and \] I think *T*-1 too many infections and things coming in . E_S
138468:8	they seem *-1 to pass a lot of , N_S
138472:13	I do n't know , E_S
138479:19	I mean I 'm sure 0 there 's some good ones , E_S
138481:13	I do n't think that I would , uh , N_S
138490:13	Uh , I think 0 the ratio of kids to teacher is really important . E_S
138499:13	Well , I think 0 \[ they had a , \+ they had \] two teachers E_S
138500:10	and I think 0 there were twenty kids , E_S
138503:13	so that was probably my own fault that she did n't , N_S
138510:15	Oh , you know , one thing 0 I noticed *T*-1 is , uh , uh , just , 0 they were trying \[ * to get her \+ *-3 to , teach her \] *-2 to write her name , E_S
138551:7	and maybe that was , N_S
138574:8	I think 0 it *EXP*-2 would be hard * to take them to people 0 you do n't know *T*-1 . E_S
138574:64	I think 0 it *EXP*-2 would be hard * to take them to people 0 you do n't know *T*-1 . E_S
138576:10	but I think 0 it *EXP*-1 's hard * to take kids to somebody 0 you do n't know *T*-2 \[ \[ and , \+ or \] \+ \] unless you have awfully good references . Reliable , uh , people , E_S
138576:63	but I think 0 it *EXP*-1 's hard * to take kids to somebody 0 you do n't know *T*-2 \[ \[ and , \+ or \] \+ \] unless you have awfully good references . Reliable , uh , people , E_S
138581:13	I do n't know , E_S
138584:13	Well , I think 0 it *EXP*-1 's hard * to leave them , E_S
138589:38	you do n't even really have any real worries , because you know that they 'll play with whoever *T*-1 's there E_S
138597:37	\[ it , \+ it *EXP*-2 \] is , I think 0 *T*-3 , just hard * to leave them because nobody will give them the kind of care 0 their own families will *?* *T*-1 . E_S
138599:15	Well , and you know \[ their , \+ kind of their \] schedules E_S
138600:11	and you know if they 're upset and that type of a deal . E_S
138605:13	I do n't know how , uh , people , uh , that *T*-1 have young kids working work full time \[ \[ and , \+ and \] \+ \] do it , really , without *-3 being stressed out all the time *T*-2 . E_S
138606:8	I think 0 it 's ,
138607:20	well , N_S I do n't know , E_S
138608:36	\[ then , \+ then \] on the other hand I think 0 it *EXP*-1 's harder * to stay home in some regards . E_S
138630:14	That 's for sure . E_S
138640:15	But , \[ I think 0 for * taking kids to a , \+ probably people that *T*-1 take them to , \] uh , preschools and day-cares full time , oh , E_S they would , I do n't know , probably just feel \[ a \+ \] different ,
138640:47	But , \[ I think 0 for * taking kids to a , \+ probably people that *T*-1 take them to , \] uh , preschools and day-cares full time , oh , E_S they would , I do n't know , probably just feel \[ a \+ \] different ,

138644:12	and you know , N_S
138659:18	Uh , Well , I think 0 universal health insurance , like national health , like what Canada has *T*-1 ,
138660:40	Is that what \[ you 're , \+ you 're \] thinking 0 the subject is about *T*-2 ? E_S
138663:8	I think , N_S
138669:8	I think 0 that 's what the subject is about *T*-1 . E_S
138681:8	I think 0 it 's a trend \[ \[ that *T*-3 's , \+ that *T*-4 's , \] \+ that *T*-1 's , \] uh , probably may go nationwide eventually because I think 0 national health is something that we all need *T*-2 . E_S
138681:91	I think 0 it 's a trend \[ \[ that *T*-3 's , \+ that *T*-4 's , \] \+ that *T*-1 's , \] uh , probably may go nationwide eventually because I think 0 national health is something that we all need *T*-2 . E_S

138690:82	So we live in a society *ICH*-2 , though , where everyone if you ask them on polls , will , uh , say that they think that everyone has a right to health care *T*-1 . E_S
138694:20	And yet , I do n't think 0 we 've ever quite decided who *T*-1 's really supposed *-2 to pay for it . E_S
138696:28	Well , that 's the thing , you know , E_S
138705:13	I do n't think 0 you , uh , N_S
138774:87	and I feel very strongly about , uh , children , and , uh , developed very strong feelings about this during our measles epidemic last year . Where we certainly proved that we 're not doing a very good job with preventive health care among children and particularly the children who *T*-1 need it most *T*-2 . E_S
138783:20	but , uh , I strongly believe that all children have a right to immunization , glasses , hearing aids , basic health benefits . E_S
138798:13	but I 'm sure that there were people that *T*-1 do n't . E_S
138806:23	So , well , I do n't know , E_S
138808:19	in case you did n't know , Texas leads the nation in uninsured children . E_S
138808:38	in case you did n't know , Texas leads the nation in uninsured children . E_S
138811:13	* Did not know that . E_S
138823:19	Uh , what do you think *T*-1 about it ? E_S
138825:13	Uh , I think 0 it 's a real good concept . E_S
138836:15	but they did n't know for sure what it was *T*-1 , E_S
138836:21	but they did n't know for sure what it was *T*-1 , E_S
138863:60	so , uh , \[ \[ we , \+ we do a , \] \+ * let me think , do we , \]
138871:43	and they talk about it \[ \[ as a , \+ you know , as , \] \+ as \] better for the country and better for the working conditions . E_S
138880:8	I know 0 we did in the military , E_S
138881:15	but I do n't know if once you 're in they continue *-1 to do it , E_S
138904:13	but MUMBLEx I think 0 the big problem , though , \[ is , \+ is \] 0 they send these off to large labs E_S
138924:11	Make * sure 0 it 's a lot safer because a couple of people are going *-1 to be discriminated against *-2 unfairly or whatever . E_S
138932:20	and then , I do n't know if he still does or what because I do n't know if Sam 's is actually part of it , E_S
138932:54	and then , I do n't know if he still does or what because I do n't know if Sam 's is actually part of it , E_S
138933:17	but he , you know is working at Sam 's now . E_S
138967:149	and you \[ have a , \+ have a \] little *ICH*-2 taken *-1 out of your check \[ each , \+ each \] payday 0 *-3 to put *T*-4 \[ against , \+ uh , uh , stock portfolio . Uh , not portfolio , just , \+ you know , against Wal-Mart stock . \] E_S
138987:10	Uh , think what else I can say *T*-1 about that .
139002:20	well , * let me think about that . E_S
139013:8	* seems to me 0 I remember that , uh , I was hired *-1 , came in and went through some orientation E_S
139014:10	and I thought 0 I , N_S
139016:11	That would seem strange * to already be working here in the first week of the drug test . E_S
139023:13	so I 'm sure 0 that happened to me , too . E_S
139054:23	and other than that , you know , it would be maybe October and then in the spring E_S
139054:37	and other than that , you know , it would be maybe October and then in the spring E_S
139069:16	So here , I know that , uh , last year there was some ice storms while I was out of the state E_S
139083:8	You may get a cold snap or two or some rain or something like 0 we 've been getting *T*-1 in December , E_S
139155:17	People that I know *T*-1 that *T*-2 come from , uh , like Georgia or North Carolina , Yeah , they say , 0 it 's , E_S
139197:27	It 's in the usually , you know , N_S
139208:8	I know .
139233:12	or you know , first an alphabet is developed *-1 E_S
139243:13	You do n't think about that as \[ a career , \+ a normal career , \] uh , when you 're thinking of things that people might be doing *T*-1 *T*-2 . E_S
139243:67	You do n't think about that as \[ a career , \+ a normal career , \] uh , when you 're thinking of things that people might be doing *T*-1 *T*-2 . E_S

139259:30	Well , \[ the , \+ uh , I think , uh , 0 all \] in all there are a lot worse climates than Dallas , uh , E_S
139260:15	the weather you know , does change fast E_S
139272:23	\[ I , \+ I \] thought 0 the fall was really nice . E_S
139292:8	you probably do a lot of that with \[ scout \+ scouting . \] E_S
139323:22	* tell me what you think *T*-1 about the Vietnam war . E_S
139329:37	Uh , E_S I 'm of the old school that *T*-1 believes that , uh , the , uh , uh , contracts that we made *T*-2 back years ago needed *-3 to be honored *-4 . E_S
139330:18	However , uh , I think 0 we could have executed the war and gotten it over a whole lot quicker .
139331:24	Uh , E_S but those are my personal thoughts , E_S
139332:10	and I think that if we 'd let the generals run the war like we let the generals run World War Two we 'd had got it over a whole lot quicker and lost a lot fewer people . E_S
139338:44	Uh , as I understand it , and I , uh , do n't know a lot about it , uh , we got in there because of France E_S
139349:36	\[ I , \+ I \] question us , you know , now , E_S
139356:19	Jerry , what did you think *T*-1 of people like , uh , Jane Fonda , another \[ war an- , \+ anti-war \] activist . E_S
139360:10	You know , \[ before she , \+ before Jane Fonda \] \[ did , \+ did \] what she did *T*-1 , I thought 0 she was a wonderful person , E_S

139365:8	Right or wrong ? E_S

139369:13	I do n't think \[ \[ is , \+ is , \] \+ \] 0 we can determine whether we were right or wrong , E_S
139369:73	I do n't think \[ \[ is , \+ is , \] \+ \] 0 we can determine whether we were right or wrong , E_S

139376:15	Uh , you know , \[ I , \+ I \] did n't realize that we 'd signed some type of deal like that . E_S
139377:8	I thought 0 we came in as first advisors to the French , and then they decided *-1 to pull out E_S
139400:15	and I do n't think 0 everybody knows the whole situation . E_S
139400:25	and I do n't think 0 everybody knows the whole situation . E_S
139408:20	\[ I \+ \] had thought that they had , uh , colonies there , or something . E_S
139416:98	and they 're also our allies in SEATO , which *T*-1 was the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization , which *T*-2 has since been , uh , disbanded *-3 as far as I know , E_S
139417:10	you know , NATO \[ is , \+ is \] on the way of * being disbanded *-1 .
139418:38	Uh , E_S but , uh , \[ the , \+ you know , the \] French ,
139421:56	Well , they got in a bind and says we do n't want *-1 to , you know , play any more E_S
139425:166	so , uh , \[ \[ we , \+ we \] kind of , \+ we kind of \] \[ got , \+ got \] the ball rolling ourselves versus a bunch of top secret silly \[ organi- , \+ uh , um , oh , operations \] and then the \[ full scale , \+ you know , full scale \] troops , et cetera , et cetera , et cetera . E_S
139438:14	I was just probably three or four years , E_S
139450:69	but I do n't like *-1 getting too awfully fancy about it , just because , um , uh , it 's too much pressure . You know , E_S
139450:79	but I do n't like *-1 getting too awfully fancy about it , just because , um , uh , it 's too much pressure . You know , E_S
139533:16	And have , you know , like three or four couples come over , E_S
139534:30	and I 'll do the potatoes and you know , like butter and cheese and stuff and have everybody else just bring a couple of toppings , whatever they like *T*-1 E_S
139538:74	and it turns out great , because I mean , you 've got like hot sauce and taco meat and barbecue and , you know , bacon and all that good stuff . E_S
139633:99	Now I 've done it \[ with , \+ \] where \[ \[ you put , \+ you cook the ri- , \] \+ well , I guess 0 you probably could do it same way , but cook the rice \] and then take a can of like cream of mushroom soup or cream of chicken soup , and put a little bit of white wine in it *T*-1 . E_S
139674:14	or , you know semi MUMBLEx . N_S
139676:20	But then , I had n't thought about *-1 doing it with uncooked rice . E_S
139701:8	I think 0 it was three quarters cup rice to two cups water , two cups , um , broth . E_S
139722:8	I think 0 it was an hour . E_S
139728:12	But , I think 0 it 's about an hour . E_S
139732:7	Or maybe it 's only half hour . E_S
139736:47	until the rice looks fluffy , \[ and \+ and \] not overdone . You know , before it gets overdone . E_S
139768:63	* put in garlic and onion powder or chopped onions if you want *-1 to do that , you know . What ever , however much effort you feel like *-2 putting *T*-3 into it . E_S
139782:20	and I mean , she thinks 0 it 's wonderful , E_S
139812:8	it seems like , we 've always been at a place where we 'd have *-2 to go away for the summer or something *T*-1 E_S
139819:14	MUMBLEx we were thinking about *-1 getting a dog if we get into a house . E_S
139823:29	Uh , someplace where there , you know , N_S

139858:54	It was \[ al- , \+ almost \] always at least one cat , sometimes , you know , like fifteen or twenty .
139867:19	but , uh , you know , you 've got *-1 to deal with , uh , *-2 taking care of them \[ and , \+ and \] feeding them and everything like that . E_S
139873:46	and they 're \[ not , \+ not \] used to it , you know , on a daily basis . E_S
139909:18	Um , I do n't know how familiar *ICH*-2 you are *T*-1 with that area of the country E_S

140049:39	It 's nice and small , which *T*-1 means , you know , 0 if you do n't get the class this semester , then you 've got *-2 to wait \[ or three or four s- , \+ you know , anywhere from two to four \] semesters *-3 to get , it again . E_S

140140:10	You know , this is like a cruelty joke , E_S
140142:61	but , uh , we had a parakeet . And , my fault , put up our first electric fan . And never thought about it . E_S
140157:8	I thought , oh so much for the bird . E_S
140172:34	but it threw him up against the wall , you know , E_S
140186:60	one year down in Florida on a vacation , for Father 's Day , my kids , years ago , maybe , uh , ten years ago , \[ go , \+ bought \] me a skunk from a exotic pet shop . E_S
140207:53	And the skunk was \[ a good , \+ a decent \] pet , E_S but , you know , does his little jobbies in the litter box , E_S and \[ is , \+ is . \] N_S
140217:26	That was sort of fun , you know , E_S

140252:37	I always told my wife , E_S I says you know , your friend 's going *-1 to get our cat one of these days . E_S
140289:32	and he 'd saved up his allowance , you know , and picked him out a bird in a bird cage E_S
140311:10	Why , sure . E_S
140316:8	I thought , yeah , right * come *-1 tell me about it , you know . E_S

140455:13	Oh , I know it . E_S
140458:8	It certainly is frightening . E_S
140494:10	So I certainly hope 0 you have a nice New Year . E_S
140499:14	that 's for sure . E_S
140504:18	but I do n't much think so . E_S
140557:16	So what do you think *T*-1 \[ of , \+ of \] * owning a home as opposed \[ to , \+ to \] * renting somebody else 's ? E_S
140631:51	Uh , \[ lots of , \+ lots of \] young couples with , you know , usu- , oh , N_S
140632:11	I 'm sure that virtually everybody in the neighborhood , that 's their first homes E_S
140638:30	\[ It 's , \+ it 's \] certainly not a real upscale neighborhood , E_S

140685:11	I 'm sure , with eight , E_S
140704:26	\[ it 's , \+ you know , it 's \] a nice home , E_S

140729:10	You know , that 's interesting E_S 0 you say that , because \[ we do have , \+ we have \] those architectural codes here E_S
140750:14	and , you know , we would have like *-1 to have had all brick , E_S
140758:43	* Kind of depends on when they get in *T*-1 , you know . E_S
140771:28	I mean , just they , you know , N_S
140811:75	Uh , \[ \[ you , \+ you 're , \] \+ you 're \] in the roughest stages of pet ownership , I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
140819:39	Well . \[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] know if that has anything 0 *T*-1 to do with the intelligence , really , \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the \] training bit , uh . E_S
140836:13	I do n't know . E_S
140857:14	and , you know , \[ you do n't want *-2 to , \+ you do n't want *-1 to \] spank it or scare it , or anything like that , E_S
140866:46	\[ we , \+ we \] try *-1 to take it , you know , N_S

140884:30	Have you praised it and given it a treat maybe when it does something outside *T*-1 ? E_S
140888:19	and , uh , you know , there 's certain spots in the house where he likes *-1 to go *T*-2 , E_S
140888:31	and , uh , you know , there 's certain spots in the house where he likes *-1 to go *T*-2 , E_S
140893:14	but , you know , that 's natural for a little puppy . Huh ? E_S
140912:10	and she knows 0 we 're there , by smell . E_S
140936:17	But , uh , I think 0 we 're buying a carpet shampooer this weekend . E_S
140940:84	\[ \[ we , \+ we try *-2 to , \] \+ we 're trying *-1 to \] take it on walks now , you know E_S

140951:28	and \[ it 's , \+ you know , I mean , it 's \] not even close to * even being trained *-1 on a leash . E_S

140959:15	You know , maybe \[ you nee- , \+ you can get \] it signed *-1 up this spring or summer for some of the dog obedience classes . E_S
140962:72	Well , \[ we 've heard bad , \+ we 've heard some bad \] things about some of those , you know , E_S
140963:45	they sometimes \[ mis- , \+ misuse \] their license or whatever you know , E_S
140969:15	Well , you know , \[ we went , \+ we went \] to the junior college , Richland E_S
140987:22	but \[ it , \+ I think 0 it \] calmed her down a little bit , E_S
140992:8	I think 0 it was like a six week program . E_S
140996:13	Uh , I think 0 it was one night a week for like six weeks , E_S
141000:19	and , uh , you know , it was a group class , outside . E_S
141003:25	Well , Sheltie Collies are , you know , timid , E_S
141050:26	We really do n't watch , I think 0 *T*-1 , as much T V as a lot of people . E_S
141084:27	It is \] hard because , you know , at the end of your day you want time for yourself E_S
141100:14	but , you know , on school nights , the two older ones get to bed about nine . E_S
141103:68	and , uh , my husband and I will go out to dinner and come home \[ and , \+ \] um , probably not too late . E_S
141110:82	You have *-1 to be a very unselfish person *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] spend a lot of time with your kids , I think 0 *T*-2 . E_S
141123:21	and even just those two days just seemed like it was a lot . E_S
141124:13	I do n't know how , N_S
141153:29	but \[ \[ it , \+ you know , it 's , \] \+ it 's , \] uh , N_S
141164:74	So what do you feel 0 *T*-1 are the current trends in the way 0 families spend time in general , you know , in America *T*-2 ? E_S
141166:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 \[ a lot of people , \+ a lot of people \] \[ s- , \+ set \] their kids in front of the T V and H B O and rent movies \[ and , \+ and , \] kind of leave them to their own means .
141174:8	I think , you know , 0 it *EXP*-1 's \[ very , \+ very \] easy * to fall into that trap , E_S
141174:18	I think , you know , 0 it *EXP*-1 's \[ very , \+ very \] easy * to fall into that trap , E_S
141182:22	But , um , um , I think 0 different parts of the country , N_S
141183:8	I think 0 in Plano and maybe this area in Texas , there 's a lot of community activities that parents could join in *T*-1 with their kids . E_S
141183:24	I think 0 in Plano and maybe this area in Texas , there 's a lot of community activities that parents could join in *T*-1 with their kids . E_S
141191:10	You know , but , um , N_S
141198:8	I know that with , N_S
141203:18	and we 're you know , thinking about *-1 having children sometime in the next couple of years E_S
141203:23	and we 're you know , thinking about *-1 having children sometime in the next couple of years E_S
141214:38	\[ And , \+ um , um , but , \] you know , if you have the type of job , N_S
141235:13	Well , I think 0 \[ it 's a big , \+ it 's a big , \] um , responsibility . E_S
141341:43	and so we have *-1 to plan anywhere from six , well really probably a year ahead of time so that everyone , can uh , start their , uh , vacation time . E_S
141352:32	and most people do not have more than you know a couple of hours drive *ICH*-1 at tops * to get there and back . E_S
141412:19	But , uh , you know , we have relatives scattered * out all over Louisiana , Mississippi , uh , here in Texas E_S
141419:10	Well , maybe this year you can find a more central location . E_S
141430:10	You know our family right now , uh , the most of it , there is only a few stragglers , uh , with any distance . E_S
141433:35	Uh , the rest of them are within , you know , a couple hours drive . E_S
141447:12	And you know this is the standard pattern . E_S
141454:30	Well , uh , uh , I guess 0 probably the last one 0 I went to *T*-1 I met so many people that I had not seen *T*-2 in probably \[ ten , \+ over ten \] years . E_S
141454:95	Well , uh , uh , I guess 0 probably the last one 0 I went to *T*-1 I met so many people that I had not seen *T*-2 in probably \[ ten , \+ over ten \] years . E_S
141461:8	I know . E_S
141481:13	Well , I think 0 that is probably why our is probably so interesting *T*-1 is cause we do n't have them that often E_S

141481:41	Well , I think 0 that is probably why our is probably so interesting *T*-1 is cause we do n't have them that often E_S
141486:27	it is like after the , you know , N_S
141519:10	Do you know what *T*-1 is on the way yet ? E_S
141524:22	and , uh , I do n't think 0 we really even want *-1 to find out . E_S
141541:17	\[ Maybe , \+ maybe \] you will get lucky and get a girl this time . E_S
141578:28	\[ She , \+ just , she \] knows people that *T*-1 does ,

141597:13	I do n't know if you have gotten into that with your kids , E_S
141612:15	So , I do know about that program E_S
141633:11	well you probably know a peace group \[ that , \+ uh , that \] \[ they \+ \] are advanced type . That they are special , well , uh , classes for peace classes . N_S
141633:14	well you probably know a peace group \[ that , \+ uh , that \] \[ they \+ \] are advanced type . That they are special , well , uh , classes for peace classes . N_S
141634:8	I think that , uh this happens *-1 to be , uh , uh , N_S
141751:10	You know , I get ready , that , N_S come about this time of year I am kind of ready for it to start *-1 getting spring , E_S
141763:28	Come about March , it gets , you know , a lot nicer . E_S
141771:14	or , you know . N_S

141784:13	Um , I think 0 I get most of my current events , N_S

142039:17	and then , you know , \[ if it 's , \+ uh , if \] they 're satisfied , N_S
142051:105	Well , I guess 0 I can just say 0 \[ I , \+ \] it *EXP*-1 bothers me that I hear a lot \[ about , \+ \] um , you know , on the news that , N_S
142052:13	well , it seems like , I do n't know , some things are sensationalized *-1
142052:31	well , it seems like , I do n't know , some things are sensationalized *-1
142053:29	or some things are , um , E_S you know ,
142055:43	and then you 'll hear that \[ it , \+ \] you know , they did n't , um . N_S
142077:21	but I have played you know different courses in in the Dallas area . E_S
142098:10	and I think 0 it is cause I do n't get as tired . E_S
142100:8	I think 0 that might be true . E_S
142100:18	I think 0 that might be true . E_S
142106:8	I know , E_S
142110:10	You know , \[ it is \+ like it is \] not going *-1 to do that much damage to the course ,
142111:13	but apparently they think differently . E_S
142118:66	but I do n't play over there because , \[ you , \+ they \] do n't , uh , you know do n't allow you to pull a cart . E_S
142122:17	And , I do n't think 0 a cart damages the turf . E_S
142132:26	So that is why we you know play over there *T*-1 E_S
142147:44	but yeah , next time 0 you go *T*-1 , uh , you know , * check into it , E_S
142150:26	and they just punch it . You know , E_S
142175:17	but my golf clubs will probably rust before I get *-1 to use them again E_S
142177:13	and it is probably going *-1 to be six to eight years before they go to college . E_S
142188:16	Well , they would probably never make it then E_S
142189:16	because I do n't think , uh , N_S
142194:32	Uh , as a course for P E you know so I could graduate . E_S
142202:36	But , uh , that is the only time 0 I think 0 I have ever really taken golf lessons *T*-1 E_S
142220:8	I know what you mean *T*-1 . E_S
142222:38	I do n't want *-1 to play strike out , you know . E_S
142227:27	\[ some , \+ uh , you know , I have some \] good shots and some bad shots . E_S
142249:8	we thought 0 even with all the cold weather weather 0 we have had *T*-1 they have been blooming just fine . E_S
142252:17	I put mine in probably in November . E_S
142254:31	That is when she did *T*-1 , I think 0 *T*-2 . E_S
142257:8	I think 0 it was November E_S
142268:37	So , if you start *-1 putting them , you know , you can put them out in the spring too , E_S
142279:19	but they make it through probably winter and spring . E_S
142318:10	You know , I , uh , camped in the Boy Scouts E_S
142319:14	and , you know , my dad and I went out sometimes E_S
142335:14	And , you know , in those those kinds of situations , uh , room rent which *T*-1 is outrageous . N_S
142362:10	You know , I had a little boat house and floated it out on Lake Grapevine . E_S
142372:57	and then we would go to work and uh , come back to the , uh , you know , boat house at night E_S
142373:29	and , uh , in the afternoon , you know , it is still four o'clock . E_S
142382:19	But , uh , you know , now all my life is more like * camping than * not camping really . E_S
142413:23	Like I said , we are probably as far as you can get from the Seven Eleven and still be in Texas . E_S
142418:19	But , uh , you know , right now , uh , what we did *T*-1 , my wife and I , is 0 we got a mobile home .

142450:44	\[ I , \+ we \] have color T V , microwave you know E_S
142469:92	First , we went up \[ * just to , \+ \] uh , with a Toyota pick up truck and laid out our sleeping bags under the stars and you know cooked our , uh , hot dogs by the fire or whatever . E_S
142482:25	my mom goes *-1 camping you know . E_S
142484:10	You know , she 's got one of these huge Winnebago 's with a refrigerator and air-conditioning , color T V , microwave oven you know . E_S

142489:59	* roughing it for me is * going to the Holiday Inn and getting a shower . You know . E_S

142513:24	So , she , uh , you know , takes the motor home . E_S
142526:95	But as far as camping , my wife and I have plans * to , uh , not really camp per se , but to drive up the , uh , you know , Highway One there in California uh , as soon as we get this house finished *-1 . E_S
142573:67	But \[ I get , \+ I have \] that problem with \[ the \+ the \] ceiling , you know , \[ the , \+ uh , the \] \[ blown , \+ blown , \] ceiling . You know where you get around the edge *T*-1 . E_S

142579:74	Now , I asked Janice , or somebody recently how you do that *T*-6 uh , when you paint the ceilings *T*-5 you know where you have got that textured stuff , that they have special rollers that *T*-1 are real soft and furry that you paint *T*-3 that with *T*-2 *T*-4 . E_S
142602:34	and that mostly does it even though you still make mistakes . E_S
142609:8	I think 0 I am going *-1 to do it this spring actually . E_S
142623:15	So , I am thinking 0 I am going *-1 to change it to , uh , something , you know , E_S
142623:64	So , I am thinking 0 I am going *-1 to change it to , uh , something , you know , E_S
142628:8	I think 0 I am going *-1 to put something like a brown on it , on the outside . And maybe , a little deeper brown *ICH*-2 in the entry way or something so it will stand out a little .

142702:28	Oh , oh , oh , oh , I know what you are talking about *T*-1 .
142712:10	and I think 0 he charged me a hundred dollars *-1 to finish up . E_S
142735:13	Oh , I think 0 that is what we might have *-1 to do *T*-2 with this chimney , E_S
142735:34	Oh , I think 0 that is what we might have *-1 to do *T*-2 with this chimney , E_S
142741:16	I mean you think , N_S
142745:10	Shoot , maybe a hundred and fifty . E_S
142751:20	But then that way you know you are assured 0 you did a good job than you are *?* , you know , if you hire someone 0 *T*-1 to do it . E_S

142783:32	and she wrung all that stuff up and made a mistake on the price of the paint E_S
142811:8	I think 0 we are going *-1 to do , uh , another bathroom , E_S
142812:10	but I think 0 I will probably just do it , in a roller . E_S

142818:13	Oh , I know . E_S
142837:19	but , uh , you know , since I live here so close to Arlington , uh , that 's the team that I 've been kind of following *T*-1 . E_S
142840:8	I think 0 it 's a little bit late in the season for them to assign us N_S
142841:14	where do you think 0 they 're headed *T*-1 , E_S
142849:14	What are your thinkings on what they can do *T*-1 , what they 'll be able *-2 to do *T*-3 *T*-4 ? E_S
142851:13	Well , I think that , uh , you know , with , uh , so much controversy over Ruben Sierra not signing and asking us for so much money , it 's , um , you know ,
142851:31	Well , I think that , uh , you know , with , uh , so much controversy over Ruben Sierra not signing and asking us for so much money , it 's , um , you know ,
142851:110	Well , I think that , uh , you know , with , uh , so much controversy over Ruben Sierra not signing and asking us for so much money , it 's , um , you know ,
142852:8	I think N_S
142853:15	I 'm not real sure about th- , N_S
142854:10	do you know anything about Ruben Sierra 's , uh , E_S
142870:35	but a little bit \[ from three , \+ you know , from thirty \] million dollars or thirty-five mil- , N_S that 's a lot of money . E_S
142872:8	I think 0 the entire baseball , N_S
142874:22	they 're the ones that probably *T*-1 are paying the highest . E_S
142879:10	And I think 0 this is absolutely ridiculous . E_S
142885:18	And \[ I really think , \+ I really think \] \[ that , \+ uh , that \] they ought *-1 to , N_S

142886:15	I 'm not real sure that they should pay him that much money . E_S
142887:8	I think 0 they should , uh , uh , pay him what his salary is going *-1 to be *T*-2 , uh , and let him , N_S
142892:20	And then , uh , who knows , E_S
142893:25	if he produces next year , they may have *-1 to end up * paying him anyway , E_S
142895:117	and they can pick him up \[ for , \+ for \] a lot less \[ than , \+ than \] they would , uh , *?* if they paid him \[ the si- , \+ you know , the six \] million dollars a year this year . E_S
142907:12	but you know , what , he , N_S
142910:16	Oh , I 'm sure 0 it was *?* . E_S
142915:8	I think 0 it was like a five year deal with , uh Pittsburgh . E_S
142922:14	So , you know , he 's real happy there . E_S
142923:39	As far as the Rangers are concerned *-1 , \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 they \[ need some , \+ definitely need some \] pitching . E_S

142927:32	Uh , and so \[ I , \+ you know I , \] N_S
142929:19	Well , what do you think *T*-1 of Howse , who *T*-2 is the coach for the pitchers ? E_S
142935:15	Well , you know , I was just looking at the news tonight , E_S
142943:10	And I think 0 that 's \[ a , \+ a \] great addition . E_S
142944:18	I mean , he seemed *-1 to know what he was doing *T*-2 E_S
142944:28	I mean , he seemed *-1 to know what he was doing *T*-2 E_S
142956:39	And I 'm not going *-1 to stand up , you know on my , soapbox and say that , E_S
142971:32	\[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] not sure \[ that , \+ um , that \] they 're ready *-1 to get rid *-2 \[ of , \+ of , \] uh , Tom Grieve yet , E_S
142972:10	but Howse might be a different , uh , situation , E_S
142973:10	and I think 0 you 're probably right , \[ that they , \+ that they \] need \[ some , \+ you know , some \] changes in , uh , pitching coach , maybe E_S
142973:23	and I think 0 you 're probably right , \[ that they , \+ that they \] need \[ some , \+ you know , some \] changes in , uh , pitching coach , maybe E_S

142976:30	Well , I 'm just gullible enough that I think 0 Bobby Valentine is , um , uh , doing all right E_S
142977:13	and I 'm sure , N_S
142983:36	That 's contrary to , uh , popular belief , you know . E_S
142985:13	Oh , I know , E_S
142986:8	I know so , E_S
142989:13	Oh , I know . E_S
142990:10	You know , it *EXP*-2 's too bad that , uh , it has *-1 to be a forty-two year old guy 0 *T*-3 \[ to , \+ to \] lead \[ the , \+ uh , the \] Rangers , you know . E_S
142990:132	You know , it *EXP*-2 's too bad that , uh , it has *-1 to be a forty-two year old guy 0 *T*-3 \[ to , \+ to \] lead \[ the , \+ uh , the \] Rangers , you know . E_S
143001:10	But I think 0 with their new stadium , they should go and let , N_S
143026:32	But , um , I guess 0 my favorite is probably Switzerland and Ireland . E_S
143094:8	I know , E_S
143114:49	once you 're there you still have *-1 to spend money . Unless you know people , you know . E_S

143116:13	Oh , I know , E_S
143133:10	You know there 's a lot of places in the states that we have n't even gone *T*-1 . E_S
143137:10	You know , I 'd like *-1 to go to Hawaii some time , E_S
143192:8	I think 0 Tennessee has been the furthest east 0 I 've been *T*-1 . E_S
143204:28	but \[ there 's , \+ you know , there 's \] a lot 0 * to see *T*-1 here E_S

143305:21	Um , but I 've always thought 0 it *EXP*-1 would be neat * to go on a safari over there . E_S
143310:44	and then she went over to Nairobi and took a safari around you know , close to Nairobi in Kenya . E_S
143382:19	and , uh , you know , everybody says , you know , how many houses *T*-1 are on the market and all that kind of thing E_S
143382:37	and , uh , you know , everybody says , you know , how many houses *T*-1 are on the market and all that kind of thing E_S
143388:23	and you can cut , you know , the listings , uh , in about a third when you go from three to four bedrooms *ICH*-1 *T*-2 you know , or five . E_S

143402:11	I 'm probably older than you , E_S
143408:41	so I can board up their rooms , and look forward to retirement maybe . E_S
143415:45	so , we 're looking forward to *-1 retiring in about three years and maybe relocating to Florida or somewhere . \[ Closer , \+ closer \] to our families . E_S

143447:13	but it 's sure , you know ,
143447:23	but it 's sure , you know ,
143456:23	You need very minimum four and probably five . E_S
143470:18	Oh , I do n't think 0 it 's possible unless you , you know , multimillionaire , something like that . E_S

143518:8	I think 0 once we get into a place , it will be just fine , E_S

143528:31	then I 'd go *-3 look because women seem *-1 to like *-2 to look a lot more than men do . E_S
143534:31	At least she 's got more opinions , you know , E_S
143535:29	\[ there 's , \+ uh , * seems like there 's \] more constraints more things that she thinks about *T*-1 . You know , openness , uh , the size of the kitchen and all this kind of stuff that I would probably gloss over *T*-2 and , maybe even ignore *T*-2 , you know . E_S

143637:67	Well \[ you can , \+ you can \] tell me a little bit more about it because I do n't think 0 we did that in Utah . E_S
143649:13	Uh , I think that the combination of , uh , technology and techniques like that together with marketplace forces will bring about a revolution in the way 0 we learn *T*-1 . E_S
143650:13	Uh , I think 0 there is a direct threat to vested interest in the public school system , uh , that *T*-1 will stand in the way of that progress being a little faster . E_S
143658:17	and , uh , I think 0 certain techniques and technologies will influence all of that as well as research , uh , uh , of the sort that people like me do *T*-3 * looking at theories of behavior and how they can be used *-1 *-1 to improve performance , particularly , uh , accelerate \[ the , \+ the \] pace of learning *T*-2 .

E_S
143663:13	I do n't know what form it will ultimately take *T*-1 . E_S
143664:22	Uh , uh , but , I think that the future is pretty bright because people recognize that we 're paying an enormous price for , uh , inferior quality when the people involved really are n't inferior *T*-1 , E_S
143672:49	\[ \[ I , \+ I \] do n't , \+ I do n't \] think 0 \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] a matter \[ of , \+ of , \] uh , talented people 0 *T*-1 to do it , \[ a- , \+ both as , \] quote , unquote students and as teachers , E_S
143682:13	I do n't know \[ how hard , \+ how hard \] is it *T*-1 , uh , in the public school system in Iowa City ? E_S
143690:149	and , uh , people there were saying that the way that the schools were going *T*-1 , a lot of people were going away and going to private schools , or else going to home , where they taught their kids at home *T*-3 .

143698:20	well , Well , uh , maybe it was the area 0 I was in *T*-1 , E_S
143700:35	Well , Utah 's a place where you would n't think 0 that problem would be very severe *T*-1 . E_S
143709:82	I mean , like you said , how \[ they were , \+ the schools \] are doing more things for the kids , they thought 0 *T*-2 , than they were *?* thirty years ago *T*-1 . E_S
143724:8	they seem *-1 to be a part of life . E_S
143737:26	\[ I , \+ I \] could probably pay them off any month if I wanted *-1 to *?* . E_S
143749:13	Uh , I think 0 they 're handy . E_S
143782:43	I use them so that I build up a credit rating , you know . E_S
143790:35	and we just keep a \[ few \+ you know , few \] of the major ones , and then use them once in a while for something , E_S
143814:10	But I know 0 some people can \[ get , \+ get , \] you know , carried *-1 away with them and let them get out of hand . E_S

143820:52	I try *-1 to keep all my receipts and keep them in someplace where I know that the bill 's going *-2 to come *T*-3 , E_S
143822:17	and so , you know , \[ s- , \+ \] a bill will come in E_S
143823:13	and I 'll think , oh , no I did n't know 0 it was going *-1 to be that high . E_S
143823:35	and I 'll think , oh , no I did n't know 0 it was going *-1 to be that high . E_S
143835:8	It seems that some of them have gotten higher E_S
143841:13	I do n't know if it was Tennessee or Arkansas or \[ some , \+ some \] other state 0 *T*-1 had a Visa card that *T*-2 was the lowest one in the country . E_S
143847:10	and I think 0 it 's eighteen percent or something E_S

143862:16	I 'm not even sure what their interest rate is *T*-1 since I pay it off E_S
143863:10	but you know , N_S
143867:13	Uh , I think 0 Sears originally put it out , E_S
143877:9	You know ,
143883:30	but if you use credit cards a lot you probably get more back . E_S
143894:13	I did n't know that . E_S
143896:10	And I think 0 the service charge is pretty low , too , E_S
143897:17	but , I 'm not sure . E_S
143899:21	Um . Well , you know , Sears was one of the few department stores that *T*-1 never would take any other credit cards . E_S
143911:14	so , you know , now they 'll take the Discover , E_S
143912:18	but I still do n't know if Sears will take Visa or Mastercard . E_S
143920:39	I just figure 0 with the Visa and American Express , I probably have an , N_S
143927:8	I think 0 it *EXP*-3 's best * to keep the number *ICH*-1 down that you have *T*-2 . E_S
143936:40	I 've got some that \[ I , \+ you know , I \] have n't even used *T*-1 at all , uh , past few years E_S
143937:8	I probably would n't be able *-1 to use them . E_S

143989:38	my own feelings about , uh , capital punishment is 0 I think 0 it should be mandatory upon a third conviction felony . E_S

144008:15	But , I do know that \[ some people , \+ almost all people \] usually die before that point . E_S
144017:8	I think 0 it should be applied *-1 , \[ d- , \+ \] on a little bit more fair manner . E_S
144019:10	and I believe it to be \[ the , \+ a \] very true axiom , E_S
144031:44	And if you 're black and you kill a black guy , you know , it 's , you know , two hundred hours of community service . E_S

144036:54	Well , it 's a social disease that we have called *T*-1 one upsmanship , you know . E_S
144053:19	But , uh , you know , we had this in the Vietnam war , you know , E_S
144053:50	But , uh , you know , we had this in the Vietnam war , you know , E_S
144054:18	we had , you know , N_S
144066:8	it sure is *?* . E_S
144068:10	You know , but that 's another issue altogether . E_S
144073:24	As far as capital punishment , I think that , uh , ten years on death row is cruel and unusual punishment . E_S
144074:8	I think 0 the guy should have ninety days E_S

144082:25	I mean , how , you know ,
144094:31	and once they found you guilty , you know , judge said , he 's guilty ,
144096:115	Well , \[ th- , \+ there \] were some people \[ that , \+ uh , that \] *T*-1 had a problem with that . Because they found out later on that , jeez , you know , a guy will lie rather than get killed *-2 . E_S
144103:23	And he 'll say , you know , hey , that guy *ICH*-1 did it , you know , not me . E_S

144582:14	what do you think *T*-1 about that ? E_S
144597:36	I mean , \[ I , \+ I \] definitely think that it 's the drug problem that *T*-1 needs *-2 to be addressed *-3 , E_S
144599:56	well someone who *T*-1 's not ready *-2 to give up drugs , uh , You know . E_S
144609:70	If they 're \[ perp- , \+ perpetrating \] the AIDS problem , passing that on to each other , then you know , N_S
144614:10	You know , I guess 0 if you consider the two problems , drug addiction and AIDS AIDS would have *-1 to come first , I guess , as far as something 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] do *T*-2 about it . E_S
144624:29	\[ So , \+ so \] I do n't know . E_S
144625:66	Uh , course , there 's so many things in the world where , if you solve one problem , you may be creating another *T*-1 , you know . E_S
144625:88	Uh , course , there 's so many things in the world where , if you solve one problem , you may be creating another *T*-1 , you know . E_S
144637:13	I do n't know . E_S
144646:10	And I know 0 a lot of our tax money goes to that . E_S
144655:21	I 've heard , you know , uh different voices speaking up and saying 0 we 're not spending enough E_S
144665:4	sure . E_S
144667:15	so I do n't know , E_S
144671:17	And , yet , I know 0 \[ it 's , \+ uh , it \] sounds like big money to me . E_S
144675:10	But it probably takes a lot . E_S
144677:8	I think 0 it is *?* . E_S
144680:8	I think 0 it is *?* . E_S
144688:8	It seems *-1 to take more than , uh , for any little thing 0 they do *T*-2 , E_S
144689:8	it seems *-1 to take a lot more money that you would think 0 it would *?* . You know . E_S
144689:44	it seems *-1 to take a lot more money that you would think 0 it would *?* . You know . E_S
144689:67	it seems *-1 to take a lot more money that you would think 0 it would *?* . You know . E_S
144705:41	a lot of \[ the , \+ my \] family , you know , they fear me working like that and , under \[ some , \+ some \] of those conditions , E_S
144723:13	I do n't think 0 there is any such thing , as a crime free zone any longer . E_S
144729:49	Uh , one evening I decided *-1 to retire early and heard sirens and noises and thought , oh , well , something 's happens on Mockingbird and then heard yells and screams E_S
144730:23	and the next thing 0 I know *T*-1 there are policemen all around my house . E_S
144758:61	so I got \[ a g- , \+ my gun \] and walked \[ to the , \+ you know , through the house into the \] garage . E_S
144760:23	but I wanted *-1 to be sure . E_S
144764:88	Is Plano beginning *-1 to experience \[ the , \+ the \] kinds of things that *T*-2 are more common \[ in the metropolitan , \+ you know , in the urban \] area ? E_S
144775:8	I think , uh , you know , 0 as any city grows up , uh , you get the hoods and the \[ roof- , \+ riffraff \] and everybody else in there , E_S
144775:23	I think , uh , you know , 0 as any city grows up , uh , you get the hoods and the \[ roof- , \+ riffraff \] and everybody else in there , E_S
144782:10	and I think , N_S
144783:15	uh , you know , fortunately the sirens and everything 0 we hear *T*-1 are over on Spring Creek , E_S
144785:27	and now \[ you , \+ you know , you \] can tell the change , for sure . E_S
144785:54	and now \[ you , \+ you know , you \] can tell the change , for sure . E_S
144790:16	Well , I was thinking , 0 if you 've been there that long , you 've seen Plano grow from what *T*-1 was really \[ a , \+ a \] small town to a city . E_S
144804:9	You know
144823:34	uh , it *EXP*-1 was really frightening * to , think that , uh , it *EXP*-2 's not even safe * to drive onto the tollway , or for those people in the tollbooth . E_S
144830:16	Uh , I never thought about someone robbing those , E_S
144833:13	I do n't know , uh , how a few bucks can be worth * shooting somebody *T*-1 E_S
144837:17	it just does n't seem possible , does it . E_S
144843:55	But I guess 0 when people do those things *T*-1 , they do n't really give a thought of the consequences at the time . E_S
144851:10	and I think 0 the drugs play a tremendous part in , uh , the theft and \[ the , \+ the \] violence that we see *T*-1 . E_S
144853:8	I think 0 you 're right , uh , although I think 0 that may be an excuse for people , too . E_S

144916:8	* sure is *?* . E_S
144918:8	It surely is *?* . E_S
144920:13	I do n't think 0 I 'd go to work without a bulletproof vest on myself MUMBLEx . E_S
144932:8	You probably , uh , more up on this subject than I am *?* , E_S
144939:42	Well , they 've entered the work force more , uh , you know , since World War Two is when they started *T*-1 . E_S
144943:17	And , uh , I think that that is , you know , very significant that the percentage of the work force today consists of such a high percent of women . E_S

144949:10	and I know 0 just especially in the last , oh , ten years and really since , N_S in the last half of dozen years I see more and more women traveling . E_S
144953:10	You know , as far as * boarding planes and driving cars and calling on customers . E_S
144957:14	and , you know , \[ it 's a , \+ it 's a \] credit to them as far as how they 're doing things *T*-1 . E_S
144965:10	You know , \[ \[ I , \+ I \] go to a , \+ I have a club that \] I belong to *T*-1 on Tuesday that , N_S
144966:10	you know , one of the girls travels quite extensively E_S
144968:10	You know , why not . E_S
144973:44	So \[ \[ that , \+ that 's \] a , \+ I think 0 that 's a \] change E_S
144974:10	and I think 0 that 's a change 0 you 're going *-1 to be seeing more of *T*-2 \[ in the , \+ in the \] future , people having that kind of attitude that the father 's going *-3 to take more active role in child rearing . E_S
144977:8	I think , uh , 0 it 's the age old thing , E_S
144978:94	every once in a while you read in the newspaper *RNR*-3 or you 'll see it on T V or something *RNR*-3 where the discussion comes out that , you know , women are paid *-1 less than men *T*-2 E_S
144983:14	and , you know , \[ I , \+ that 's \] a very true statement E_S
144984:56	and \[ it should n't , \+ uh , it should n't \] be that way . You know . E_S
144989:28	\[ That , \+ that \] I think 0 *T*-1 \[ should change , \+ will change \] in the near future also . E_S

145004:29	And you hear some people say , you know , N_S well , he 's a man , E_S
145012:13	Also , I think , uh , 0 a good argument for that is in the area of politics , you know , E_S
145012:66	Also , I think , uh , 0 a good argument for that is in the area of politics , you know , E_S
145014:20	a woman Congressman I 'm sure 0 *T*-1 makes as much as a man Congressman \[ as , \+ \] and the same as a senator or whatever . E_S
145018:17	So , \[ they certainly , \+ uh , they certainly \] deserve it all the way . E_S
145018:33	So , \[ they certainly , \+ uh , they certainly \] deserve it all the way . E_S
145030:10	And I think 0 if , N_S in the future it 's even going *-1 to be , uh , more noticeable and more significant . E_S
145034:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 it will be *?* . E_S
145035:13	\[ I think , \+ I , \] well , N_S
145049:84	And if they 're out there *-1 buying that many cars , then there 's that many out that *T*-2 are self sufficient and , you know , mobile and working . E_S
145063:10	You know , she certainly did her part in * help *-1 getting me establishing in my business E_S
145063:18	You know , she certainly did her part in * help *-1 getting me establishing in my business E_S
145095:23	Well , * trying *-2 to think what else I can say *T*-1 in regards to this subject . E_S
145097:13	I do n't know , E_S
145100:35	You see the old , uh , cigarette ads , you know , about you 've come a long way . E_S
145110:8	You think about this \[ when you come to , \+ when it comes to \] a subject like that *T*-1 E_S
145113:14	and , you know , N_S
145122:112	and we went through the process of *-1 searching for child care and uh , finding what we consider *T*-2 to be , real good child care at a , uh , pretty reasonable price , we think . E_S
145165:10	Uh , probably . Uh , E_S
145178:41	So , depending on what my class schedule looks like *T*-1 , he may spend \[ four , \+ \[ si- , \+ \] anywhere from four *RNR*-2 \+ \] to eight *RNR*-2 hours a day in child care at that point . E_S
145181:28	Uh , I get out of class at certain time E_S
145183:10	You know , E_S once a day this overlap *ICH*-1 happens where we ca n't , one of us be home *T*-2 . E_S
145192:29	Well , that 's a good experience , I think 0 *T*-1 , E_S
145193:44	and , uh , there are a lot of things 0 * to think about *T*-1 E_S
145220:18	They 've been here probably thirty , forty years . E_S
145241:37	I th- , N_S if it 's good , N_S I think 0 *T*-1 it 's very good for the child . E_S
145245:31	And if it 's , a loving environment , I think 0 *T*-1 it 's very good E_S
145255:13	I do n't know what it 's like *T*-1 around , uh , Hattiesburg . E_S
145284:8	I know 0 \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] a real hard thing 0 * to do *T*-1 , even for people \[ in , \+ in , \] uh , university communities . E_S
145288:50	Out here at Manford , they have \[ \[ \[ a , \+ you know , a , \] \+ a , \] \+ a \] real good facility E_S
145293:46	So \[ \[ \[ it 's , \+ uh , uh , you know , it 's \] a , \+ it 's a , \] \+ it 's an \] important , decision , E_S
145300:10	and I think 0 this \[ is b- , \+ really is buyer \] beware . E_S
145312:8	I think that , uh , my own interest \[ in , \+ in \] \[ development , \+ human development \] leads me to believe that that 's a good sign and that , uh , private enterprise is the way 0 * to go *T*-1 and that it will lead to a fundamental change in the way 0 we learn *T*-2 . E_S
145312:78	I think that , uh , my own interest \[ in , \+ in \] \[ development , \+ human development \] leads me to believe that that 's a good sign and that , uh , private enterprise is the way 0 * to go *T*-1 and that it will lead to a fundamental change in the way 0 we learn *T*-2 . E_S
145322:13	Because , I think 0 what we 're going *-1 to go to *T*-2 is much more commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market . E_S
145323:59	As a matter of fact , my future is banked *-1 on that , uh , professionally because I believe \[ that , \+ that \] there are , uh , pressing needs in the marketplace , unmet * by schools , colleges universities for , uh , * learning a lot of things that kids can learn *T*-2 *-3 watching Sesame Street and in child care . E_S
145350:28	\[ \[ I , \+ I \] know pe- , \+ I know some other people \] that *T*-1 have done that . E_S
145350:42	\[ \[ I , \+ I \] know pe- , \+ I know some other people \] that *T*-1 have done that . E_S
145359:77	I have a , uh , gas card \[ that I , \+ that I \] use *T*-1 just for gas and you know , uh , one that I use *T*-2 just for emergencies E_S
145368:27	\[ They , \+ uh , you know , they \] kind of overextended and borrowed and borrowed E_S
145376:8	I know it . E_S
145398:28	and \[ \[ it , \+ you know , I mean , they , \] \+ they 're \] just a convenience for me . E_S
145408:59	but in most cases , I 'm glad 0 I do n't because \[ I , \+ you know , unfortunately \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] \] do n't have the control 0 you have *T*-1 . E_S
145419:29	Uh , and \[ it , \+ you know , it , \] N_S
145429:17	so what , you know . E_S
145433:23	even with my gas card you know , I find that I 'll go in *-1 to get some gas E_S
145437:33	and I 'll end up *-1 buying , you know , candy and drinks and you know , sweets and whatever , E_S
145437:52	and I 'll end up *-1 buying , you know , candy and drinks and you know , sweets and whatever , E_S
145441:44	and then at the end of the month \[ I , \+ you know , I \] get a bill E_S
145442:13	and I 'm thinking what *ICH*-3 did I get *T*-1 , that *T*-2 costs so much . E_S
145453:15	Well , you know , but the , N_S
145462:44	but \[ I can , \+ I can \] \[ under- , \+ certainly understand \] where , N_S
145466:8	You know , N_S
145469:19	the thing that *T*-1 probably helps me most *-2 doing that is really , you know , uh , not so much discipline , E_S

145506:23	\[ I , \+ I \] know what you mean *T*-1 about the interest rates .
145509:10	You know , \[ I just , \+ that just \] irritates me so much \[ that , \+ that \] I refuse *-1 to pay them interest E_S
145515:14	but , you know , she could pay it off , E_S
145521:39	I mean , she 's paying , \[ I do n't know , \+ I do n't know \] what per month , you know , forty , fifty dollars per month in interest E_S
145521:58	I mean , she 's paying , \[ I do n't know , \+ I do n't know \] what per month , you know , forty , fifty dollars per month in interest E_S

145538:132	\[ I , \+ in fact , \[ I 've , \+ I 've \] \] even , uh , heard some people that *T*-1 have applied for credit cards with much less , uh rates and have paid off their , you know higher interest rate , uh cards and just sent them back , you know . E_S

145583:10	you know , he wrote a book on it E_S

145602:23	and I 've got , you know , N_S
145610:14	What do you think *T*-1 about it ? E_S
145615:30	so I told my husband , uh , you know , N_S
145618:209	but , uh , uh , \[ hi- , \+ in his \] family , uh , what they usually do *T*-1 , on his dad 's side , his mom or , uh , the aunts will send out little postcards , like , two or three weeks before * reminding everyone \[ \[ where the , \+ the , \] \+ where * to \] meet *T*-2 and , you know , *-3 just , to bring anything , E_S

145668:26	I mean everyone 's , you know mostly not farther than an hour away . E_S
145697:14	and , you know , a lot of that sort of thing . E_S
145699:51	Now next time 0 we have one *T*-1 , E_S we 'll have *-1 to think of something more creative 0 *-3 to do *T*-2 . E_S
145701:15	Well , you know , that 's interesting because one thing that *T*-1 always brings to my , uh , husband 's mother 's side together is , uh , 0 they talk about the genealogy of the family tree every time E_S
145703:37	\[ and , \+ and \] they always have , you know , two or three new ones 0 *-1 to add *T*-2 to the list , you know ,

145814:80	I can tell you about my last job or whatever you want *-1 to talk about *T*-2 that or my husband 's or what I think *T*-3 . E_S

145931:28	Even at a group rate , I could n't believe how much is our , N_S

145948:124	I guess 0 \[ what , \+ \] the other benefits \[ \[ that , \+ uh , that I , \] \+ uh , that I \] miss *T*-1 , I guess is , uh , you know , some of the bonuses and stuff \[ that \+ that \] *T*-2 goes on with just * being involved *-3 with a big company , you know E_S

145983:26	\[ I , \+ I \] really believe 0 they have done this to themselves , in a way , because of the unions being so stocked . E_S
145993:8	Plus probably an additional six months through \[ the , \+ the \] worker 's stuff that they have *T*-1 \[ \[ at , \+ at , \] \+ uh , through \] the company E_S
145994:31	so \[ I 'm sor- , \+ you know , I 'm sorry \] 0 it 's happening because it 's going *-1 to hurt , E_S
146017:10	You know , that 's the ones \[ \[ that \+ that \] \+ that 's \] going *-1 to hurt *T*-2 because they depend on that , uh , E_S
146021:10	But I think 0 there 's a case , where benefits have gotten , N_S
146025:78	and they got so good , I mean , like two dollars for a prescription no deductible on the medical , all these things , you know E_S

146111:33	and in December everyone was doing stockings , you know these gorgeous , detailed minute , tiny stitch stockings . E_S
146125:48	and I just do n't have the patience 0 * to just , you know , do something *T*-1 . E_S

146202:185	Well , one thing that I like *T*-1 about this fabric painting thing is 0 I can just make a T shirt and put a little ruffle around it and then , um , cut out a little pattern *ICH*-2 \[ from the material , \+ from some material , \] like flowers or something , and make , um , a design or , you know , a little arrangement or something on the shirt and , you know , fuse it on with Heat and Bond , or whatever and then paint around it .

146238:10	but I think 0 you 're very clever *-1 to , um , sew around the edges . E_S
146239:8	I think 0 gluing alone , certainly if you wash it any amount of time , it tends *-1 to kind of come loose at the edges . E_S

146302:20	and they 're , you know , already out with number six by now , E_S
146330:60	But , \[ I like , \+ I like \] the older ones because at that time , you know , they were really futuristic , you know . E_S

146374:43	I mean he does n't even try *-1 to let the person know 0 he 's getting onto them . E_S
146376:13	Well , it seems like they always show COLOMBO ,
146377:33	the same ones *ICH*-3 over and over , though you know what I 'm saying *T*-1 , like that one where he goes to college *T*-2 , N_S
146411:16	see I do n't know if that 's \[ a , \+ the \] movie of the week \[ or , \+ or \] what , E_S
146412:10	but it seems like there 's only about four or five different ones , E_S
146432:14	I like COLOMBO probably the best of any of those mystery things . E_S
146440:13	I do n't think so . E_S
146456:47	They 'll say , so and so from TWIN PEAKS , or something , you know . E_S
146477:48	\[ they did n't , \+ they only did \] it for , I think , two years . E_S
146512:8	We might as well *?* . E_S
146523:18	Well , I do n't think that uh , any of my relatives would really like *-1 to go there . E_S
146524:23	\[ I , \+ I \] believe , if I , am in a position , uh , like when my mother gets to a point where she needs special care *T*-1 *T*-2 that I will be able *-4 to just bring her *ICH*-3 into my home and my father also , \[ and \+ uh , or \] have someone go into their home , you know \[ and \+ uh , and \] look \[ after \+ \] them .

E_S
146531:112	I would find it *EXP*-2 very difficult , uh , * to , uh , place \[ eit- , \+ \] my father or my step-mother uh , in a place like that . Particularly , since I know how they feel about it *T*-1 . E_S
146541:107	And it is like they feel , \[ 0 they are , \+ \] uh , the way 0 my mother would put it *T*-1 like somebody had thrown them away . You know ? E_S
146546:11	I do think that there are some significant kinds of things 0 * to to look for *T*-4 *ICH*-1 , you know , if you are faced *-2 with * placing someone . In a place like that , uh , you know , aside from the cleanliness and the medical care that *T*-3 is offered *-5 and such E_S

146558:17	And , uh , I know that the cheerful pleasant people who *T*-1 treat her kindly make all the difference in the world in how she feels *T*-2 about , uh , her situation . E_S
146561:24	And another thing 0 * to think about *T*-1 , uh , on the positive side of the nursing homes here , N_S
146578:89	\[ some , \+ some \] of \[ the , \+ uh , the \] people that *T*-1 are in there are \[ real , \+ you know , very \] nice and friendly to everybody E_S
146584:18	and they just you know want *-1 to go in and do what they have *-2 to do *T*-3 and get out go home . E_S
146596:8	I think 0 it would matter too , uh , kinds of , uh , disabilities that the nursing home accepts *T*-1 . Because there are some , uh , who *T*-2 poor things , you know , do n't have , uh , any real grasp on reality any longer . E_S
146596:114	I think 0 it would matter too , uh , kinds of , uh , disabilities that the nursing home accepts *T*-1 . Because there are some , uh , who *T*-2 poor things , you know , do n't have , uh , any real grasp on reality any longer . E_S
146603:10	And they may be ambulatory , E_S
146608:26	and that would be very difficult I think 0 *T*-4 0 for an adult who *T*-1 was n't in that situation to to have *-3 to deal with *T*-2 on a daily basis . E_S
146643:16	Well , I definitely think that we need *-1 to start *-2 recycling . E_S
146644:8	I think 0 it has got *-1 to be an individual responsibility until , N_S
146645:8	I think 0 if we wait *ICH*-3 , uh , which *T*-1 is happening until somebody says 0 we have *-2 to do it it is going *-4 to be to late . E_S
146655:15	but I do n't know how it is *T*-1 there . E_S
146677:20	and then , I do n't know if you note , 0 even * doing that , the amount of trash 0 we throw *T*-1 away is incredible E_S
146680:11	Oh I know . E_S
146689:43	We have a pilot program in Arlington *ICH*-1 *-2 going on I think in the north part of the city where they \[ are \+ have \] \[ people \+ people \] separate \[ the garbage as , \+ the trash as \] they put it out *T*-3 . E_S
146691:8	I think 0 that is a good idea . E_S

146711:10	And I think 0 it is going *-1 to come to that because some people will just not go to the , N_S
146728:22	and , so , I do n't know . E_S
146729:8	I think 0 there needs *-1 to be more places E_S
146731:45	In Iowa , the state 0 I am from *T*-1 uh , I believe 0 it has gone up to a dollar now *T*-2 . E_S
146753:13	I do n't know if you 've tried it E_S
146778:13	I do n't think that there is enough being done * . E_S
146794:10	And I know 0 there is a lot of computer paper that you ca n't use *T*-1 . E_S
146812:20	Something else 0 I think 0 we \[ do \+ can do *T*-1 \] is * support companies that *T*-2 encourage N_S
146825:10	And I think 0 packaging could be done *-1 much better . E_S
146829:11	Well I know , E_S
146831:65	and then when they come out with the new things *T*-1 , you are like , well why did n't you think of that before *T*-2 . E_S
146835:10	And I think that it 's just 0 people have got *-1 to be aware . E_S

146843:10	You know , I want *-1 to feel like I at least tried . E_S
146847:15	And I do n't know . E_S
146848:11	It just may overwhelm us here when we run out of places 0 * to put it *T*-1 *T*-2 . E_S
146850:8	It may be too late . E_S
146852:45	\[ Do they not ever , \+ I mean , I do n't know that much . Do they not ever \] burn trash or anything like , N_S

146903:26	and then I wore heels , you know . E_S

146933:8	I know , E_S
146936:12	it *EXP*-1 might kill you * to go up and , walk up to the door E_S
146965:40	Of course , we wear , uh , an unlined boots , you know , E_S
146968:23	and we wear them , you know , E_S
146983:122	As I have a private high school that I run *T*-1 here \[ and so \+ \] when I 'm interviewing a parent *T*-3 , of course I feel like I need *-2 to wear heels you know , and look like I 'm a business person .

147100:59	one of the things 0 they asked me *-1 to ask you *T*-2 was where you thought 0 the major source *ICH*-4 was coming from *T*-3 ? Or sources . E_S
147102:22	\[ I , \+ you know , I \] assume , that the major sources are cars and factories . E_S

147406:10	You know , we 're the generation moving into this E_S
147407:15	and I do n't know how our kids are going *-1 to take care of us *T*-2 . You know . E_S
147407:63	and I do n't know how our kids are going *-1 to take care of us *T*-2 . You know . E_S
147430:15	and I do n't know how he is ever going *-1 to get on his own the way 0 things are *T*-2 *T*-3 . E_S
147432:13	Oh , I know . E_S
147437:58	Uh , luckily , if we could be like your grandmother , \[ I , \+ uh you know , I \] would love *-1 to live to a hundred and two if I were okay . E_S
147463:10	Oh , sure . E_S
147474:36	I mean my mom is kind of old-fashioned , you know . E_S
147478:26	So , \[ I , \+ you know , you \] pick up some traits from her and stuff . E_S
147479:22	But , uh , \[ I think 0 it 's , \+ I think 0 it *EXP*-1 's \] interesting and better for women to see that there 's \[ more , \+ more \] of them doing men 's fields . E_S
147479:43	But , uh , \[ I think 0 it 's , \+ I think 0 it *EXP*-1 's \] interesting and better for women to see that there 's \[ more , \+ more \] of them doing men 's fields . E_S
147481:39	And I do n't like *-1 to see women , you know , like waiting on men hand and foot E_S
147485:15	but , you know , \[ I , \+ I \] believe in like * sharing and doing things for each other . E_S
147485:37	but , you know , \[ I , \+ I \] believe in like * sharing and doing things for each other . E_S
147500:8	I think 0 it 's great . E_S
147510:14	but , you know , \[ I , \+ he 'll \] help me do the dishes . E_S
147511:30	I do n't want *-1 to , you know expect *-2 to help * to clean up then after MUMBLEx . E_S
147525:25	If they did that , you know . N_S
147531:143	And a big thing that I see *T*-1 . \[ All that , \+ \] \[ most of the , \+ most of the \] women getting * married *-2 now , uh , \[ go back , \+ have gone back to , \] you know , N_S
147543:10	And I believe 0 we 'll see a lot more C E O -s in companies . E_S
147548:10	And I think 0 we 'll see a lot more . Do n't you ? Of upper management ? Then we do now , even . E_S
147556:8	I think 0 it 'll escalate . E_S
147560:29	\[ And , \+ uh , and \] I think 0 black women now N_S
147567:10	And I think that th- , N_S
147568:34	and the ethnic thing \[ will be , \+ you know , is \] a good thing now . E_S
147575:69	so you 're going *-1 to see \[ a lot , \+ a lot \] more of that in leadership I believe 0 *T*-2 . E_S
147579:8	I think 0 it *EXP*-1 's , uh , really neat * to see *ICH*-4 and all that educated minority , uh , person who *T*-2 really knows what they 're talking about *T*-3 . E_S
147579:84	I think 0 it *EXP*-1 's , uh , really neat * to see *ICH*-4 and all that educated minority , uh , person who *T*-2 really knows what they 're talking about *T*-3 . E_S
147583:41	And it *EXP*-1 's just too bad that some people , you know , still look down on them just because of their color . You know . E_S
147583:81	And it *EXP*-1 's just too bad that some people , you know , still look down on them just because of their color . You know . E_S
147597:15	But they would n't know what they 're doing *T*-1 . E_S
147608:35	But I never have gone along with that , you know . Even far back . E_S
147614:15	ther- , you know , N_S
147624:26	So \[ that 's , \+ I think 0 that 's \] good . * To keep the equal as far \[ as , \+ as , \] uh , not , \[ \[ nex- , \+ nex- , \] \+ uh , necessarily \] by sex type thing . You know . E_S

147630:10	And I think 0 the , uh , attitude *ICH*-1 is a lot better towards the parents raising the younger ones now . E_S
147634:56	You see a lot more of the mothers and all saying to the young girls , you know you can do it . E_S
147644:77	\[ I , \+ I \] see more men , uh , like participating in like the family things with children . Like , you know , helping * to take care of them more . \[ And \+ and , \] uh , uh , doing the jobs equally , you know , E_S

147657:10	Do you think 0 the political scene ? N_S
147667:13	and I really think 0 we should have more political leaders *ICH*-1 *ICH*-2 in the women than we do \[ up for , \+ and even for \] President and Vice President this year , E_S
147673:8	I think 0 they 're all scared *-1 out \[ after tha- , \+ after , \] uh , N_S
147678:18	Oh , I do n't know . E_S
147680:10	But you know who I mean *T*-1 ? E_S
147683:8	I know who you 're talking about *T*-1 . E_S
147690:43	At least she was strong *-1 to like try it and you know . E_S
147707:20	And right now I do n't think 0 we have too many . Uh , \[ th- , \+ in the \] forefront . E_S
147717:8	I think 0 the first thing 0 they said *T*-1 ,
147720:28	\[ is it p- , \+ do you think 0 it *EXP*-1 's possible \] * to have honesty in government or an honest government ? E_S
147728:13	Uh , I think 0 it probably is more likely if you have a small government unit where everybody knows everybody *T*-1 . E_S
147728:23	Uh , I think 0 it probably is more likely if you have a small government unit where everybody knows everybody *T*-1 . E_S
147728:62	Uh , I think 0 it probably is more likely if you have a small government unit where everybody knows everybody *T*-1 . E_S
147733:26	But , uh , other than that I think 0 maybe it just depends on how you define honesty *T*-1 . E_S
147733:33	But , uh , other than that I think 0 maybe it just depends on how you define honesty *T*-1 . E_S
147735:31	\[ That 's an int- , \+ you know , that 's interesting . \] E_S
147740:10	And I thought 0 that was interesting . E_S
147742:44	It was just government in general . From times past , you know on E_S
147752:16	How many do you think 0 *T*-1 are in there for \[ pub- , \+ for bu- , \] N_S
147755:31	and personally I feel 0 \[ it 's probably , \+ there 's probably \] some of each . E_S
147755:45	and personally I feel 0 \[ it 's probably , \+ there 's probably \] some of each . E_S
147759:10	But I think 0 maybe a lot of them , um , N_S
147759:17	But I think 0 maybe a lot of them , um , N_S
147760:50	say the more honest ones who *T*-2 are still looking out for themselves , it may be more matter of not what can I steal *T*-1 while in an office but how many friends can I make *T*-3 while , I 'm in office . E_S
147767:14	And , you know , how good a name can I make *T*-1 for myself and so forth . E_S
147772:19	The president of General Motors probably has the same , N_S
147780:53	Third question was how \[ m- , \+ \] MUMBLEx serving for their own gains do you think 0 *T*-1 goes on , N_S
147783:16	\[ I 'm sure 0 there 's a lot . \+ But I agree with you , 0 there 's a lot \] in business . E_S

147786:17	\[ \[ I think \+ I- , \] \+ I think \] 0 a little more honesty in the campaigns would be , more to the point . E_S
147786:37	\[ \[ I think \+ I- , \] \+ I think \] 0 a little more honesty in the campaigns would be , more to the point . E_S
147788:8	I think 0 we put too much on politicians . E_S
147789:47	We expect them to only be there *-1 to serve us , you know . E_S
147804:20	a lot of times I think 0 it 's our own fault . E_S
147817:15	and I do n't know why anybody would want *-1 to get under that scrutiny anymore *T*-2 . E_S
147821:29	Because \[ it 's , \+ I think it 's \] gotten *-1 just care- , well , N_S
147829:13	and it almost seems like in order *-1 to avoid , uh , some of the scandal , you would have *-1 to have the kind of wife that you would only find *T*-2 , \[ on , \+ say in \] the Bobsy twins or , something like that . E_S
147834:10	You know , I also think 0 it would be funny if we could know everything about the people that *T*-1 were in there and throw them out . E_S
147834:21	You know , I also think 0 it would be funny if we could know everything about the people that *T*-1 were in there and throw them out . E_S
147834:51	You know , I also think 0 it would be funny if we could know everything about the people that *T*-1 were in there and throw them out . E_S
147835:13	I do n't think 0 there would be too many left * . E_S
147855:23	And then they also , you know , \[ ask can we eliminate , \+ do you think 0 we could make laws 0 *T*-1 to eliminate \] all corruption , E_S

147856:15	and I do n't think 0 we can make laws 0 *T*-1 to eliminate anything anyplace totally . E_S
147865:13	I do n't think 0 * making laws will stop it . E_S
147866:21	I mean I do n't know how many laws you would have *-1 to have *T*-2 . E_S
147873:9	* sure did n't , did it ? E_S
147879:8	I think 0 you can legislate E_S
147880:10	but I think 0 there 's no way that you eliminate it all by legislating *T*-1 , E_S
147881:42	and we would end up with so many more laws that , you know , N_S
147882:19	I mean I just think 0 that 's human nature that you 're going *-1 to have corruption in government , in business , personal life , I mean , you know . E_S
147882:103	I mean I just think 0 that 's human nature that you 're going *-1 to have corruption in government , in business , personal life , I mean , you know . E_S
147884:13	Actually , I think 0 other countries may have it worse , uh , E_S
147884:25	Actually , I think 0 other countries may have it worse , uh , E_S
147896:11	I still believe 0 I get very fed up with government sometimes E_S
147897:15	but when I think about where I 'd want *-1 to go *T*-2 *T*-3 , you know , this is still the best E_S
147897:58	but when I think about where I 'd want *-1 to go *T*-2 *T*-3 , you know , this is still the best E_S
147903:8	I think , uh , N_S
147907:16	at its worst I think 0 we 've got the best . E_S
147911:47	Well , I have *-1 to say 0 my favorite type of music would probably be , uh , classical music . E_S
147939:81	\[ I , \+ I \] have n't gotten into that too much because , \[ I , \+ uh , if I \] do n't know the story line and , um , I do n't speak the language , then I have difficult time , *-1 comprehending what *T*-2 's going on . E_S
147941:69	Well , one thing that *T*-1 's helped us a lot is that , uh , \[ you , \+ you know , you \] can buy a lot of these operas now on \[ video casse- , \+ uh , video tape \] E_S
147953:14	But , you know , the , uh , Dallas opera now has , uh , super titles \[ on , \+ on \] all their performances I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S

147959:18	Oh , I did n't know that . E_S
147968:30	So , I 'd say , 0 Vivaldi is probably my favorite , uh , composer . E_S
147980:83	I like full body music , uh , \[ with the , \+ um , um , with \] brass and winds , woodwinds , instruments , you know . E_S
148017:17	Well , since you seem *-1 to like , uh , Italian music , have you ever , uh , gotten into Gabrielli or anybody there in that era , the , uh , period right before , actually before Vivaldi , I guess ? E_S
148020:43	but , um , a lot of the , um , music I do n't know about *T*-1 , uh , as far as the titles , E_S
148036:10	but I think 0 I know what it is *T*-1 . E_S
148036:20	but I think 0 I know what it is *T*-1 . E_S
148041:14	Uh , they know have them on compact disc \[ \[ or \+ or , \] \+ uh , or \] cassettes or L P -s , E_S
148049:8	I think , uh . E_S
148116:68	and I take , uh , DISCOVER magazine , and also , uh , C D AND STEREO REVIEW and NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC , I think and BOYS LIFE . E_S
148138:52	Oh , uh , and do you receive discounts and things like that , E_S do you think N_S
148162:8	I may have referred to a couple of them , E_S
148229:13	I 'm not sure that , um , in the case of NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC , N_S
148235:90	but then eventually there 'll be a school project or something where my son will need *-1 to refer back through forty-eight back issues *-3 to find you know , France or something or whatever *ICH*-6 it is *T*-2 0 he 's looking for *T*-5 *T*-4 . E_S
148278:89	And he takes \[ GAMES MAGAZINE \+ GAME MAGAZINE , \] which *T*-1 has puzzles and things that he likes *-3 to solve *T*-2 , you know , crosswords and various logic puzzles and things like that E_S
148312:29	You 're just sort of beginning *-1 to think about first grade . E_S
148353:33	\[ I , \+ uh , I \] do n't think 0 I 've ever met a type of music 0 I do n't like *T*-1 except for , uh , maybe , you know , heavy metal and that . E_S
148353:97	\[ I , \+ uh , I \] do n't think 0 I 've ever met a type of music 0 I do n't like *T*-1 except for , uh , maybe , you know , heavy metal and that . E_S

148370:33	Well , as far as the rap goes , I think 0 there are a few artists that *T*-1 appeal to me themselves E_S
148387:57	But \[ I , \+ I \] like *-1 to listen to , uh , what you might call *T*-2 pop , easy listening country western , jazz uh , classical , um , E_S
148421:4	sure . E_S
148424:8	You might try that . E_S
148436:14	but , you know , jazz can get on my nerves after a while . E_S
148437:37	Uh , you ca n't just listen to it , you know , \[ to , \+ \] uh , especially a lot of the deeper stuff , E_S
148441:33	you have *-1 to concentrate on it , it seems 0 *T*-2 . E_S
148472:28	uh , they 've all got , you know , the real screechy electric guitars now . E_S
148481:26	and I even liked Jim Reeves you know E_S
148505:43	Asleep At The Wheel . Uh , Sons of the Pioneers , you know , stuff like that . E_S
148518:8	it seems like you get a lot of original music that way . E_S
148521:8	you sure do . E_S
148523:20	I mean , you know , * think about like the Twin Peaks and stuff like that that *T*-1 's just real recent E_S
148523:28	I mean , you know , * think about like the Twin Peaks and stuff like that that *T*-1 's just real recent E_S
148549:8	it sure is *?* , E_S
148563:14	and , you know , what *ICH*-2 I like *T*-1 the most about him , is , I 've gone *-3 to see him in concert , and \[ he always , \+ he looks \] like he 's having fun . E_S
148566:4	sure . E_S
148594:8	I think 0 it was like five of them or something E_S
148649:64	Uh , I 've done , uh , perpetual calendars and cookie jar lids and , oh , on and on , you know , just things like that , E_S
148673:38	and tole painting is just \[ a , \+ \] you know , something 0 I do *T*-1 in my spare time E_S
148698:75	I just bought a spray gun , one of those \[ \[ airless , \+ uh , not airless , \] \+ high volume , low pressure \] spray guns . E_S
148712:37	Oh , well \[ that 's \+ that 'ud \] probably give you a smoother finish , would n't it *?* ? E_S
148765:13	I do n't know if you 've ever heard of those . E_S
148811:13	I do n't know if I necessarily want *-1 to do furniture , E_S
148843:11	You 're probably a veteran at this . E_S
148854:10	so I think 0 you 'll enjoy *-1 doing it . E_S
148863:15	Uh , you know , there 's a shop in Roy that I really love *T*-1 . E_S
148874:21	I 'm trying *-1 to think of the name . E_S
148876:8	I know where fifty-six hundred south is *T*-1 . E_S
148887:25	Huh , well , um , you know , I guess 0 it 's pretty deep feelings , uh , E_S
148898:107	I really appreciated \[ the , \+ the \] whole , uh , English class where \[ the , \+ uh , the , \] uh , fellow just would n't do it *T*-1 , you know , E_S
148904:10	You know , * what for him to finish me off . N_S
148927:15	Um , you know , \[ both my , \+ well , both my \] brothers were , um , draft age , E_S
148928:46	but neither of them wound up *-1 going over , which , I think 0 they were very happy for *T*-2 . E_S
148930:37	Well , \[ I , \+ personally , uh , you know , uh , I \] just went in limbo . E_S
148942:26	I mean , I just did n't know . E_S
148956:20	Um , \[ do you think , \+ I mean , do you think , \] 0 \[ our invest- , \+ the investment \] in lives and money was worth it ? E_S
148956:43	Um , \[ do you think , \+ I mean , do you think , \] 0 \[ our invest- , \+ the investment \] in lives and money was worth it ? E_S
148966:35	\[ What , \+ what \] effects *ICH*-2 do you think 0 it 's had *T*-1 on our country ? E_S
148970:14	and , you know , MUMBLEx presidents have always avoided that as a country . E_S
148974:30	So it 's pretty serious , really , you know , E_S
148978:8	I think MUMBLEx you know , 0 that 's pretty typical \[ that , \+ \] of the \[ entire , \+ entire \] involvement over \[ that , \+ you know , that \] nothing was really addressed *-1 , E_S
148978:19	I think MUMBLEx you know , 0 that 's pretty typical \[ that , \+ \] of the \[ entire , \+ entire \] involvement over \[ that , \+ you know , that \] nothing was really addressed *-1 , E_S
148978:100	I think MUMBLEx you know , 0 that 's pretty typical \[ that , \+ \] of the \[ entire , \+ entire \] involvement over \[ that , \+ you know , that \] nothing was really addressed *-1 , E_S
148979:47	\[ \[ it was- , \+ it was n't , \] \+ you know , it was never \] N_S

148981:54	it was such a gradual and subtle , you know \[ thi- , \+ um , you know increasement \] \[ of , \+ of \] force that . E_S
148995:41	and finally President Johnson said , well , they 're were n't really sure whether it was a dolphin or a torpedo . E_S
149002:49	so , um , \[ \[ do , \+ do , \] \+ do \] you think that like , uh , um , for example like \[ in , \+ in \] this past war , in the Persian Gulf war \[ \[ that , \+ uh , that \] \+

149042:11	I 'm probably eventually going *-1 to get a three eighty-six .
149051:35	Um , but \[ I , \+ um , I \] think 0 eventually I 'll start *-1 using it for spreadsheets and things like that . E_S
149058:62	so I 'll be able *-1 to send and receive faxes right over there without *-2 using , you know , N_S
149069:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 \[ I , \+ I 'm \] planning on like *-1 moving up , getting a three eighty-six before I move up to windows although , you know , I do like \[ the , \+ the \] graphical user environment . E_S

149118:60	and the teacher just \[ tries * to , \+ tries *-1 to \] teach English , you know , through natural understanding . E_S
149124:8	You seem *-1 to be , uh , better informed *ICH*-2 than the average person on that . E_S

150372:8	I think , N_S
150386:8	I think 0 the biggest frustration is 0 because of the cost of insurance going up every year , our district has had *-1 to \[ alter , \+ uh , you know , change \] companies , E_S
150386:100	I think 0 the biggest frustration is 0 because of the cost of insurance going up every year , our district has had *-1 to \[ alter , \+ uh , you know , change \] companies , E_S
150402:10	but it seems *-1 to be a good way 0 * to maintain costs and still provide a good amount of coverage *T*-2 . E_S
150411:56	and , um , I was *?* because \[ my , \+ my \] same doctor , you know , agreed *-1 to be in it for , uh , N_S
150424:45	Uh , if you 've been going to a doctor for , you know , ten years or something and he elects *-1 not to join , it can be very stressful for you know , those people . E_S

150441:17	and , uh you know , for me it 's worked out real good . E_S
150447:22	but if you , you know , have a family \[ and , \+ and , \] um , everybody 's gone to different doctors , uh , it *EXP*-2 is hard * to give up somebody who you feel 0 *T*-1 knows you and your body and \[ your , \+ \] just has , you know , all the medical history E_S

150485:13	I do n't think 0 most of our teachers , N_S

150492:41	It is just , 0 Texas has really , um , you know , N_S
150497:15	and I do n't know who *T*-1 looks forward to it more , the students or the teachers and the staff . E_S
150512:31	Um , and we 're given *-2 , you know , a good bit of flexibility in what we do *T*-1 . E_S
150517:11	I would think that that type of employment , \[ \[ you 're , \+ you 're , \] \+ one day you might be \] really tuned in and the next day , oh , a little luke warm or something E_S

150527:34	now we do have *-1 to work , you know , the day , E_S
150551:11	Those are probably the two main things 0 I like *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S
150560:93	Um , \[ \[ in , \+ in , \] \+ in \] the winter , \[ you , \+ \] typically \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] probably too cold * to go out and do things like tennis . E_S
150570:28	so it 's mostly indoor sports , I think 0 *T*-1 , in the winter . E_S
150584:67	\[ It 's \+ it 's \] kind of kept me from *-1 getting cabin fever and , um , has seemed *-2 to be a real nice aerobic exercise . E_S
150602:13	I do n't know if you 've heard of it , E_S

150680:35	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 my ankles probably are my main weak point . E_S

150800:43	And the people 0 I work with *T*-1 are pretty , you know , \[ up , \+ up-to-date \] on that kind of stuff , E_S

150852:8	I think 0 you get a very lopsided picture of what *T*-1 's going on . E_S
150856:26	they give each candidate perhaps , you know , ten second blurbs in which * \[ to , \+ you know , to \] say *T*-1 ,

150876:15	It , you know , N_S
150881:156	and \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] real good because it gives like a brief summary of *RNR*-4 , or like the updates , like of *RNR*-4 what *T*-1 's going on in science without *-5 getting into a lot of detail that *T*-2 would , you know , bog me down that I would n't know about *T*-3 E_S

150925:79	\[ If they reported every , \+ if they reported every \] violent crime in Atlanta \[ it would take , \+ it would probably take \] the whole news hour . E_S

150975:79	they way 0 they do the newscasts *T*-1 , I wish 0 \[ they , \+ they \] kind of separated it , you know , E_S
150979:8	I think that , uh , one , uh , advantage of * having , uh , the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want *-1 to make * sure that you do n't , uh , convict someone who , uh , *T*-3 really should n't be convicted *-2 . E_S

150983:58	Um , and I think that , you know , a unanimous verdict , uh , helps *-1 to ensure that . E_S
150984:15	I guess 0 maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who *T*-1 is very unreasonable in some way , that , uh , you , uh , would have a problem , uh , you know , that you would n't convict someone who *T*-2 maybe should be convicted *-4 . E_S

150998:21	They were just , you know , small time cases where , uh , trailers and banks were involved *T*-1 , you know . E_S

151011:58	Uh , the jury , \[ it was , \+ uh , * let me see , I think 0 it was \] ten to one on the jury , because they only had *-1 to have eleven people E_S
151021:23	So it became unanimous , you know , after they turned it in E_S
151041:14	and , you know , it was seat belt law E_S
151053:25	so I have n't been , you know , a jury eligible age for very long E_S
151065:54	Uh , \[ one , \+ one \] thing that \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 *T*-1 \[ is , \+ um , you know , maybe is \] a problem is , uh , \[ I , \+ I \] think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now , E_S

151107:82	The one thing 0 I sometimes wonder about *T*-1 , um , in civil cases is , uh , whether , especially sort of in , uh , maybe like \[ pro- , \+ product \] liability , or medical malpractice , where there 's , um , sort of a very technical decision 0 *T*-2 to be made *-3 sometimes *T*-4 N_S
151111:10	you know , it 's not just a matter \[ of , \+ um , of , \] you know , did this guy rip off this guy , E_S

151113:37	it 's sort of a matter of , um , you know , * sometimes getting into very technical issues , E_S
151114:134	and I wonder \[ \[ if , \+ uh , if there 's really , \] \+ um , if the system \] works adequately \[ in , \+ in \] *-1 educating the jurors about , uh , whatever , um , you know , issue *T*-2 is under discussion . E_S
151116:28	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't think that \[ \[ they , \+ they , \] \+ they \] educate them enough * \[ to , \+ to \] really know what *T*-1 's going on . E_S

151122:128	\[ the , \+ the \] bank was suing them \[ for , \+ uh , \] because they went *-1 to get \[ the , \+ the \] trailer \[ that , \+ which \] *T*-2 was , uh , seemingly their property . E_S
151160:14	and , you know , there 's no way 0 they could *?* *T*-1 because \[ it , \+ it \] was the moving company , E_S
151204:77	well most of the time \[ we , \+ we \] spent *T*-3 *-1 sitting around in the jury room and getting *-2 to know the other potential jurors E_S
151208:96	and then , it was always exciting when we got called *-1 *-4 \[ \[ to , \+ to , \] \+ to \] go *T*-2 , because then we thought 0 we might be able *-3 to do something else besides , uh , * just sit in the jury room . E_S
151208:106	and then , it was always exciting when we got called *-1 *-4 \[ \[ to , \+ to , \] \+ to \] go *T*-2 , because then we thought 0 we might be able *-3 to do something else besides , uh , * just sit in the jury room . E_S
151227:48	but it 's just whether the prosecutor or the defense attorney feels like , you know , N_S
151240:10	and I think 0 part of it was 0 \[ they did n't , \+ uh , they did n't \] like the fact that I do n't drink any more . E_S
151247:14	Because you 'd probably be , uh , too puritanical E_S
151251:11	that was probably it , E_S
151255:19	although in my case I might have been more , uh , sympathetic with the person who *T*-1 got caught *-2 , E_S
151256:13	I do n't know . E_S
151261:72	So , uh , \[ were , \+ were \] the , uh , sentences that the judge handed *T*-1 out what you thought *T*-2 to be fair , E_S
151263:25	if you were deciding , do you think that they would have been different . E_S
151273:22	and I , uh , did n't think that , uh , * going in without *-2 deliberating allowed us to reach a verdict , E_S
151287:47	\[ \[ I ju- , \+ I , \] \+ I \] do n't know , E_S

151321:8	I know 0 on a , N_S

151323:26	It 's a simple majority , you know , rules . E_S
151334:13	I do n't know , E_S
151342:14	and , you know , * being fair to the person , if the government does n't prove its case , no matter how you feel *T*-1 , you have *-2 to go by what *T*-3 's offered *-4 as proof , E_S
151373:10	and I think 0 it 's mostly for \[ the , \+ the \] field people that , you know , *T*-1 drive trucks and heavy machinery , that kind of stuff . E_S

151390:13	Oh , I thought 0 it was just like marijuana or cocaine . E_S
151429:20	so that 's , you know , N_S
151430:82	I 'm all for it , because \[ the , \+ well , the \] type of environment 0 I work in *T*-1 , you know , they 're working with explosives , E_S
151438:8	I think that , uh , you know , under certain circumstances , especially when you 're working \[ in , \+ in \] high risk , uh , uh , industries , where you can really hurt other people *T*-1 *T*-2 , \[ that , \+ that \] you need *-3 to have that kind of stuff . E_S

151444:56	as long as it 's not abused *-1 , uh , you know , random , you know , N_S
151464:26	So , \[ it , \+ you know , it 's \] sort of one of these little catch twenty-twos . E_S
151467:8	I think 0 our policy is that , N_S
151468:18	all right , it 's probably the same thing . E_S
151469:16	I 'm not really sure what the , N_S
151477:10	But I know , 0 they do have counseling , and that they do give you a second chance , E_S

151486:102	I mean , \[ if , \+ if \] they 're going *-1 to give you the opportunity * to turn yourself in , then they ought *-2 to , you know , go out of the way , I think , a little bit more *-3 \[ to , \+ uh , to \] \[ help you get , \+ help *-4 get you \] rehabilitated *-5 *-5 \[ to , \+ you know , to \] \[ get \+ get \] back at your job . E_S
151486:128	I mean , \[ if , \+ if \] they 're going *-1 to give you the opportunity * to turn yourself in , then they ought *-2 to , you know , go out of the way , I think , a little bit more *-3 \[ to , \+ uh , to \] \[ help you get , \+ help *-4 get you \] rehabilitated *-5 *-5 \[ to , \+ you know , to \] \[ get \+ get \] back at your job .

151492:20	Uh , \[ do you think 0 it works very good with that random , \+ do you think 0 it limits , \] N_S

151505:44	So , uh , I 'd rather *ICH*-2 have that than , you know , *-3 say well , this week the A -s and B -s are going *-1 to be in E_S
151516:8	I know one employee , E_S 0 I know , 0 when I was working with *T*-1 *T*-2 , *T*-1 he had alcohol on his breath , E_S

151563:10	do you think 0 it *EXP*-1 's okay for a company to reject somebody *-2 knowing that they 'll take drugs ? E_S
151563:52	do you think 0 it *EXP*-1 's okay for a company to reject somebody *-2 knowing that they 'll take drugs ? E_S
151566:22	Well , \[ \[ I think , \+ I think \] \+ \[ we , \+ I \] think \] 0 the problem here \[ is , \+ is \] that \[ a , \+ a \] drug test does not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs . E_S

151572:38	I do n't think 0 there 's any definitive , you know , N_S okay this person is taking drugs , E_S
151577:37	Uh , like I said , some industries , though , I think 0 it 'd be very necessary , E_S
151584:14	or , you know , it , N_S
151585:27	\[ I just , \+ I \] think 0 it 's a whole trust issue . E_S
151611:13	and I just thought 0 it *ICH*-4 was dumb of the company , at a point where they were trying *-1 to convince me \[ to , \+ to \] want *-2 to work for them *T*-3 * to do this , E_S
151615:53	and I 'm just like , well , uh , I 'm not even going *-1 to think much about it if you 're going *-2 to treat me with this much respect even before you 've gotten *-3 to know me . E_S
151615:125	and I 'm just like , well , uh , I 'm not even going *-1 to think much about it if you 're going *-2 to treat me with this much respect even before you 've gotten *-3 to know me . E_S
151624:78	\[ That 's , \+ that 's \] basically my opinion on it , right there , is that it 's just , you know , N_S
151630:10	and I know people who *T*-1 have been drug tested *-2 and who *T*-3 have not , you know , been hired *-4 by a corporation which , uh , you know , N_S

151637:28	just to the fact that I do n't know that it *EXP*-1 is a company 's business * to regulate what its employees are doing *T*-2 when they 're not at work *T*-3 . E_S
151638:73	I mean , during the eight hours , during the day , when they 're supposed *-1 to be there *T*-2 , I think 0 they have every right *-3 to say \[ this is , \+ these behaviors \] are acceptable *T*-4
151656:16	And also I just think 0 \[ it , \+ it \] gets a lot , N_S
151658:10	and I think that it just moves down along a line \[ that , \+ that \] I really would find *T*-1 bad \[ if , \+ if \] most people went down that line into *-2 regulating employees ' lives outside of work , you know , E_S
151658:147	and I think that it just moves down along a line \[ that , \+ that \] I really would find *T*-1 bad \[ if , \+ if \] most people went down that line into *-2 regulating employees ' lives outside of work , you know , E_S
151664:15	Well , you know , \[ I , \+ I \] can see how they can say in the work place 0 \[ we , \+ you \] do n't want them to smoke *T*-1 , E_S
151665:34	but when somebody leaves work *T*-1 , I do n't think that it *EXP*-2 's the employer 's right * to regulate their life style at all . E_S
151667:15	Well , do you think 0 it *EXP*-1 's , should be illegal for an employer to do this E_S
151670:16	Uh , I really think 0 it should be *?* , except as I 've mentioned twice now , in the specified industries \[ or , \+ or \] jobs , because there are certain things where it *EXP*-1 's just vital that a person is clear minded at all times *T*-3 . E_S

151675:8	I think 0 it *EXP*-2 should be illegal for them \[ to , \+ to \] want *-1 to do that . E_S
151681:19	even though I do n't think 0 I 'd work for a company that *T*-1 did that , I sort of want *-2 to defend an employer 's rights \[ as opposed to an in- , \+ uh , in addition to an individual 's \] rights , E_S
151682:24	but an employer , really , I think 0 *T*-2 , has the right *-3 to hire someone on any basis 0 they want *-4 to *?* *T*-1 E_S
151728:30	so \[ I , \+ I \] kind of know how * to do these things *T*-1 . E_S

151743:23	She has like seven sisters I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
151758:23	it 's about two hundred people , maybe . E_S
151763:22	Um , \[ the , \+ probably the \] biggest challenge was * getting a place where everyone , you know , could eat comfortably \[ and , \+ and \] everything *T*-1 , uh . E_S

151767:15	I guess 0 probably the most helpful thing was that , um , for the rent , we rented like \[ a , \+ a \] rescue squad building or something like that . E_S
151782:28	And each person in the family , you know , brought a dish , or something . E_S
151793:10	You know , everybody brought their specialties , I guess 0 you would say 0 *T*-1 . E_S

151815:11	she looks probably like she 's in her early sixties E_S

151869:25	Uh , my immediate family , you know , \[ my , \+ my \] parents and my brothers and sisters , I guess 0 we 're the ones that *T*-1 have the gypsy blood or whatever , E_S
151916:8	I might as well *?* . E_S
151923:29	that 's stuff 0 we never even thought about *T*-1 three years ago . E_S
151928:37	uh , they could be made *-1 , uh , you know , inexpensive and lots of it , uh , E_S
151941:27	But , uh , there 's , you know , the ton of after market machines , and et cetera , et cetera . E_S
151945:31	And that 's got me very , you know , highly concerned that , uh , that 's going *-1 to be quite a while before we can , uh , undo this . E_S
151951:55	but you got *-1 to have people that *T*-2 can \[ make , \+ you know , earn \] a salary 0 *-3 to pay for this conversion *T*-4 . E_S
151958:19	and then do , you know , that number ,
151977:64	and that 's a \[ pollut- , \+ polluting \] type deal too , is the excessive , um , you know , uh , petroleum products in your engine bay and so forth ,
151986:10	and I know 0 there 's a lot of pollutants 0 we ca n't even see *T*-1 coming out of cars , E_S
151992:85	Well , \[ \[ most , \+ most , \] \+ most \] of the time when you see \[ bus , \+ uh , you know , the busses \] with the diesel *T*-1 \[ that 's , \+ uh , those \] are carbon particles , and carbon dioxide and water vapor , uh , E_S
151997:10	you know diesel fuel is burned *-1 \[ in a , \+ in the \] diesel engine E_S
151998:201	it 's burned *-1 so completely , that you do n't have any , uh , nitrous oxides , uh , or oxides of nitrogen , uh , 0 * to , uh , form *T*-4 \[ because of , \+ by virtue of \] the very combustion process of the diesel engine , because diesel oil \[ is , \+ uh , is \] not very volatile . You know , where gasoline , if you leave a little pail of gasoline out before long it 's gone *-3 . E_S
152010:15	well , you know , its latent heat is high , E_S
152011:45	but it 's slow burning \[ at , \+ at , \] uh , normal pressures . E_S
152012:82	That 's why your diesel engines have such high compression ratios *T*-2 \[ as the , \+ as the \] air is heated *-1 , you know , by virtue of the compression process to like one to nineteen or nineteen to one ratio E_S
152102:15	and I do n't think 0 they 've taken the stoves . E_S
152104:15	and this year I believe 0 *T*-1 they will be in tents also . E_S
152184:78	and , uh , one thing that *T*-1 is a big concern in the evening , at night , uh , is , uh , make * sure that all the food 's put *-2 away and so forth because , uh , we have , uh , armadillos . E_S
152188:10	Do you know what armadillo is *T*-1 ? E_S
152215:76	But most time they run away from you \[ if they , \+ if they \] see 0 you 're up , you know N_S
152257:73	and uh , our benefits package \[ is n't , \+ uh , is n't \] quite as good in some ways . Uh , you know , E_S
152278:47	Uh , so \[ the , \+ uh , the \] benefits , E_S uh , probably the main thing 0 I like *T*-1 about the benefits is \[ the , \+ uh , the , \] uh , very generous vacation time and sick time . E_S
152298:8	You maybe get two or three a year . E_S
152307:48	So , \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] kind of a drawback I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
152308:22	But , uh . I do n't know . E_S
152309:33	What do you consider *T*-1 most important , you think , in terms \[ of , \+ of \] the different benefits ? E_S
152311:13	Well , I think , uh , 0 \[ the , \+ the \] health care , of course , is an important *RNR*-2 , and has *-1 to be the single most important *RNR*-2 benefit E_S
152315:41	and , uh , the rates that we keep *-2 paying *T*-1 seem *-3 to keep *-4 increasing , uh you know , E_S
152315:71	and , uh , the rates that we keep *-2 paying *T*-1 seem *-3 to keep *-4 increasing , uh you know , E_S
152320:10	but I think 0 that 's a national trend , E_S
152321:20	and \[ I do n't know that , \+ uh , I do n't know what \] the solution *ICH*-2 is *T*-1 to it . E_S
152321:44	and \[ I do n't know that , \+ uh , I do n't know what \] the solution *ICH*-2 is *T*-1 to it . E_S
152325:13	I do n't know if you saw on TWENTY TWENTY the other night , E_S 0 \[ they , \+ uh , they \] basically reviewed \[ Oregon 's plan \+ or The Oregon Plan \] toward , uh , * nationalizing health care and that kind of thing . E_S
152353:8	I think 0 you 're right , E_S
152354:8	I think 0 health care is probably \[ \[ the , \+ the most pressing \] \+ uh , the pressing \] one , E_S
152354:23	I think 0 health care is probably \[ \[ the , \+ the most pressing \] \+ uh , the pressing \] one , E_S
152358:68	but I 'll tell you , 0 \[ I , \+ I \] do n't mind *-1 having dental , you know , E_S
152360:10	and I know 0 historically a lot of companies I think carried dental as a rider along with the medical E_S
152360:37	and I know 0 historically a lot of companies I think carried dental as a rider along with the medical E_S
152364:15	but I 'm not sure 0 \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] widely followed *-1 any more . E_S
152365:13	I 'm not sure , E_S
152370:8	I think 0 it costs me something like five dollars \[ a , \+ a \] month for the dental plan . E_S
152382:29	is that generally across the board , do you think *T*-1 E_S
152395:8	I think 0 \[ the , \+ the \] health and all that and the dental *ICH*-1 is the same for everybody , and the retirement plan . E_S
152403:57	Uh , for the operating staff it 's \[ on a seniority , \+ it 's , you know , based *-1 on how long they 've worked there *T*-2 . \] E_S
152424:46	That 's one of the things 0 I 'd like *-1 to think about *T*-2 is in what kind of benefits \[ they would , \+ uh , they would \] cover *T*-3 and things like that . E_S
152437:34	I was just going *-1 to say 0 I think 0 one of the biggest thing for me is room for advancement . You know , * not to get \[ in , \+ like in \] a dead end job . E_S
152437:82	I was just going *-1 to say 0 I think 0 one of the biggest thing for me is room for advancement . You know , * not to get \[ in , \+ like in \] a dead end job . E_S
152441:54	And plus , for me , it 's , uh , I mean like medical and you know , uh , benefits and dental . E_S
152472:23	and I suppose 0 that 's maybe a disadvantage of * being in a larger institution , perhaps somewhat even with the business , uh . E_S
152473:20	But I agree , you know , 0 the , uh , medical benefits and those kinds of things *ICH*-1 are one of the big pluses of * working for a large organization and also the , uh , security aspect for long term employment , uh , E_S
152475:15	Well , you know that 's interesting though . E_S
152476:16	Because I do n't know if that 's necessarily the case anymore . E_S
152477:19	I use *-1 to think that , you know , after you work , N_S
152477:32	I use *-1 to think that , you know , after you work , N_S
152483:36	Uh , that use *-1 to be *?* I think a couple of years ago , E_S
152484:15	but I do n't know if it is *?* so much anymore . E_S
152490:20	I mean , you know , some people had been there a long time . E_S
152498:31	Uh , so \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 \[ there \+ it 's \] probably a major distinction between institutions and the corporate world in , uh , institutions are slower * to react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where the businesses , we need *-1 to cut back , that 's what we do *T*-2 . E_S
152498:57	Uh , so \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 \[ there \+ it 's \] probably a major distinction between institutions and the corporate world in , uh , institutions are slower * to react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where the businesses , we need *-1 to cut back , that 's what we do *T*-2 . E_S
152519:52	\[ where the most dollar , \+ \[ where , \+ where \] \] you know it cuts back the most *T*-1 . E_S
152531:8	I think 0 that 's one of the things too . E_S
152532:28	You get too many management people , you know . E_S
152537:124	and it *EXP*-1 's very easy for them to say , oh this is the best way when they really are n't aware of what all it took *T*-2 * to get the work done *-3 *T*-4 you know . E_S
152555:21	so what else do you think 0 *T*-1 is important ? E_S
152558:12	that 's maybe the majority of the importance , I guess 0 *T*-1 . E_S
152568:34	but if you 're in the corporate world , I think there is considerable motivation for I guess \[ in- , \+ innovation , \] E_S
152569:28	although \[ he , \+ \] you know , * the more complex 0 your structure *?* *T*-2 the , uh , less difficult it *EXP*-1 is *T*-3 * to kind of carry some things through E_S
152573:17	but , uh , I think 0 \[ there is , \+ uh , it 's \] a long term type of process where in a small organization \[ it 's , \+ \] uh , things can happen much more quickly E_S and so you can see the reward of the efforts . E_S
152575:8	I think 0 probably in a small , N_S
152575:15	I think 0 probably in a small , N_S
152578:8	You probably have a better team , uh , cooperation , or team playing , atmosphere . E_S
152583:26	where as in a bigger corporation , I think 0 *T*-1 you 're just a number , you know . E_S
152583:56	where as in a bigger corporation , I think 0 *T*-1 you 're just a number , you know . E_S
152591:12	and you know you really , N_S
152597:8	I think 0 you would be more willing *-2 to either help that person or help it get accomplished *-1 , you know . E_S
152597:72	I think 0 you would be more willing *-2 to either help that person or help it get accomplished *-1 , you know . E_S
152601:34	It becomes the organization instead of person being you know a part of the individual themselves . E_S
152612:14	In that it seems to me that they are swayed *-1 more *ICH*-4 by emotion than , uh , by evidence that *T*-2 's presented *-3 . E_S
152620:11	I was thinking primarily criminal cases . E_S
152622:15	So , do you think that , I mean \[ the \+ the \] stereotypical bleeding heart juries where they feel sorry *T*-1 . E_S
152629:40	Uh , I would feel more comfortable *ICH*-1 in many cases I think 0 *T*-2 with judges . Uh , you know , doing the sentencing . E_S
152629:68	Uh , I would feel more comfortable *ICH*-1 in many cases I think 0 *T*-2 with judges . Uh , you know , doing the sentencing . E_S
152632:65	\[ The other thing , \+ the only thing \] that *T*-1 really bothers me about that is 0 I think you know , that a judge can be N_S

152645:23	Uh , Uh , too often I think 0 they are not *?* E_S
152652:135	and , uh , \[ when you , \+ when you are \] selecting a jury and you are doing it partially \[ if , \+ if \] not entirely on the basis of which color representation you have *T*-1 *T*-2 you know that is a matter of concern to me too . E_S
152656:13	Uh , I think that , uh , in such cases , uh , they are not really looking for unbiased people , but rather for biased . E_S
152660:26	Uh , now I happen *-1 to know several judges E_S
152668:49	but the other two I feel 0 *T*-1 , uh , would give either you know , the plaintiff or for the defendant the the full benefit of the law . E_S
152678:79	well , what I do n't like *T*-1 about , uh , \[ sentence , \+ the jury doing the sentencing \] in that I think 0 it becomes a lot less , N_S
152686:28	\[ I , \+ uh , I \] think 0 there is more of an ability \[ of \+ you know , you know for \] * selecting \[ a jury , \+ two different juries \] that *T*-1 would most of the time come up with \[ the same idea , \+ uh , the same idea \] versus you know whether he is guilty or innocent E_S

152693:17	but , \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 there would be a large variation \[ in , \+ in \] * trying *-1 to gage \[ the \+ the \] severity of the crime and an appropriate punishment and have \[ that \+ that \] measure stick across the board . E_S

152721:8	You know where he says * kill all the lawyers *T*-1 . E_S
152729:107	But , \[ I , \+ it *EXP*-2 's taken me \] a long time * to understand that , uh , lawyers are concerned with the law and not with justice \[ as we think of , \+ you know , \[ as , \+ as \] novices tend *-1 to think \] that , uh , attorneys care about justice . E_S

152869:17	so . I do n't know . E_S
152878:21	but it 's just you know , N_S
152880:39	Well , \[ it does it , \+ it does \] seem that the more taxes that *T*-1 are raised *-2 the more the politicians spend *T*-3 . E_S

152919:25	I mean it *EXP*-3 does n't seem right that somebody that *T*-1 makes twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars pays four or five thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that *T*-2 makes two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes . E_S

153707:22	My wife uses hers just for pleasure E_S

153771:28	Well , I have a hard time * thinking that they can control guns . Personally . E_S
153781:10	You know , even if they give it a shot , it 's still going *-1 to be black market all over the place , you know , E_S

154146:29	\[ They , \+ they \] generally make mistake on anything technical at least . E_S

155206:56	but what they do *T*-1 is * employ , uh , \[ homeless , \+ I think mostly men , but homeless \] people to uh , go out and collect all the recyclable cans E_S
155207:22	\[ and \+ and \] I think 0 it 's mostly cans . E_S
155208:8	There may be bottles as well ,
155220:46	but , uh , we do n't have much of a situation where we might call them homeless people *T*-1 . E_S
155221:8	We certainly have a fair number of people that *T*-1 are on \[ welfa- , \+ welfare \] and unemployment insurance and that kind of thing . E_S
155222:19	Uh , there 's psychological pressure against * employing people to do that kind of thing although , uh , scouts and hockey teams and ball teams , those kinds , uh , regularly do bottle drives where they go around in various neighborhoods and collect the bottles at individual homes *T*-1 . E_S
155239:13	I do n't know if you are familiar with that . E_S
155262:25	but , uh , it does n't really seem *-1 to be \[ too , \+ too \] tight if we just remember *-2 to keep everything \[ up , \+ up \] to date and balanced . E_S
155270:58	so we needed *-1 to start *-2 doing more of that just for , uh , you know , * saving for college and things like that . E_S
155278:8	I know . E_S
155295:17	and then , you know , now we 're just going on the one income E_S
155300:24	* find some extra payroll deductions is probably the only way 0 we will be able *-1 to , uh , do it *T*-2 . E_S
155301:10	You know , * kind of enforce the savings . E_S
155328:13	I do n't know how many people *T*-1 are , uh , getting involved in this E_S
155358:13	Uh , * probably need *-2 to try *-1 to get back on the topic E_S
155359:99	but , uh , it *EXP*-1 's hard * to talk about finances \[ without \+ without \] *-2 getting to , uh , dollar figures I guess 0 *T*-3 you know , E_S
155368:16	Uh , well I think , 0 either my wife or I would like *-1 to pursue advanced degrees at some point E_S
155373:8	It seems like every year my employer just gives back , you know , a little bit your tuition reimbursement . E_S
155373:41	It seems like every year my employer just gives back , you know , a little bit your tuition reimbursement . E_S
155390:76	\[ \[ I 'm , \+ I , \] \+ uh , it 's \] called *-1 living within your means . You know , which *T*-2 means at the moment , * paying off the VISA bill and keeping everything else under control and hoping 0 the car does n't collapse . E_S
155415:21	We 're trying *-1 to think of how * to put away some savings and stuff like that *T*-2 E_S
155428:17	But , we do n't know how long it will be a dream *T*-1 . E_S
155433:118	so we 're stepping real careful and trying *-1 to see what *T*-2 's the best way 0 * to save \[ what , \+ the little bit that \] we do get *T*-3 , you know , on top of expenses every month *T*-4 . E_S
155488:28	\[ I , \+ uh , I \] know who they are *T*-1 . E_S
155495:46	\[ \[ There , \+ there \] was , \+ uh , you know , there was \] a fairly large building \[ \[ that \+ that \] *T*-2 was \+ well that *T*-1 belongs \] to them . E_S
155509:10	You know they really need surveyors cause \[ you could , \+ you 're \] free *-1 to travel anywhere . E_S
155518:70	I 'm not bilingual in any of them because I kept *-1 switching from one area to the other , you know , E_S
155519:20	since I did you know , complete a survey in one area , I 'd switch to the other . E_S
155523:10	So I know the greetings in about ten , and how * to do market stuff *T*-1 , E_S

155550:13	I do n't know what I said *T*-1 to him E_S
155563:24	Uh , so , what do you think *T*-1 , uh , about * putting the elderly in a nursing home ? E_S
155565:13	Well , I think that \[ it , \+ it \] varies \[ on \+ on \] the individual basis . E_S
155574:8	you may not even have family \[ that *T*-1 is , uh , uh , in , \+ you know , who *T*-2 are around . \] E_S

155648:8	I think 0 that 's also where you 're going *-1 to have a lot of people who *T*-2 are going *-3 to *T*-4 , N_S

155668:10	You know , you need *-1 to check them out ahead of time . E_S
155675:13	uh , I know some . E_S
155694:12	Who *T*-1 know what they 're doing *T*-2 with that . E_S
155697:45	\[ so , \+ so \] there 's different types of nursing homes I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S

156120:23	but it seems that automobiles would probably do more than their fair share of that . E_S
156127:15	uh , you know , there are a large number of them on the road . E_S
156128:20	They 're all , you know , going , E_S
156132:22	a big issue is , you know , E_S 0 a lot of states do n't have a , uh , inspection law E_S

156153:10	and I think also 0 some of the , uh , car companies are coming out with , uh , gas powered fleets so you , N_S

156188:61	\[ it 's , \+ it 's \] the type of thing there that , uh , you know , N_S
156195:22	The U S used , you know , all the air pollution stuff and air polluting technologies *-1 to get where it is today *T*-2 . E_S
156198:100	And that 's one of the arguments that the Third World countries have been using *T*-1 is , that basically they do n't want *-2 to have *-3 to pay for our mistakes \[ if , \+ if \] that makes any sense . E_S

156245:49	those are actually areas that *T*-1 are hit *-2 pretty hard , I would think 0 *T*-3 . E_S

156297:30	Uh , every evening at six thirty , I believe , E_S I watch the national news . E_S
156300:16	Well , I would probably be a junkie or \[ s- , \+ watch \] C N N a lot , E_S

156338:117	For a while there \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I , \] uh , subscribed to NEW YORK TIMES , \[ a- , \+ actually \] a couple of newspapers because , uh , you know , my fiance , N_S

156365:13	uh , I think 0 if you listen to like N P R or something like , N_S
156379:109	instead of *-3 being , as your newspaper or your T V news where you get a five minute blurb or a ten paragraph blurb *T*-2 , they go really in depth on topics which I think 0 *T*-1 is good . E_S
156384:14	their editorial stand point seems *-1 to be a lot better than , say , your major network news and that kind of thing . E_S
156393:34	Uh , I guess 0 a year ago you 're probably watching C N N a lot ,
156403:35	Uh , but \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know , E_S

156720:8	Quicker maybe , E_S
156749:30	and , see , I 'm afraid 0 I think if we would take the equivalent amount of money and invest it in young people , that , N_S

157475:106	\[ but , \+ so , \] I guess 0 \[ the , \+ the \] question was more like , uh , do you \[ get what you pay f- , \+ you know , get what you pay for *T*-1 . \] E_S
157481:10	you know , they need *-1 to make a living . E_S
157486:12	So , I think 0 \[ \[ for , \+ for , \] \+ for \] many years , uh , we 've paid teachers and police officers and firemen who *T*-1 are , uh , to a great extent , public servants uh ,
157499:136	and , so , \[ I , \+ I \] kind of do n't pay a proportionate amount of taxes \[ to , \+ \] I guess , uh , compared to what I get *T*-1 , because \[ I , \+ \] you know , all \[ my , \+ my \] education is state sponsored . E_S
157502:80	so I guess 0 I 'm kind of in debt , \[ I , \+ I \] suppose , because I do n't , you know , been paying taxes \[ all that , \+ all that \] long . E_S
157503:83	My parents , I guess 0 *T*-1 , \[ \[ h- , \+ h- , \] \+ however , \] have contributed to that , you know , for the education side of it and everything , E_S
157523:11	We do think that , uh , sometimes , uh , we have a reverse of a regressive tax , a progressive tax . E_S
157527:19	And progressive tax , I think 0 *T*-2 , uh , does not give people incentive *-1 to make more money , E_S
157532:21	It should be , I think 0 *T*-1 , a flat percentage E_S
157557:14	But , you know , \[ there 's f- , \+ there 's \] a lot of taxes 0 you pay *T*-1 that you 're not even aware of *T*-2 that you 're paying *T*-3 , uh , E_S like when you buy a tire *T*-1 , you pay a federal excise tax . E_S
157567:24	The taxes that people do n't think about *T*-1 that , N_S
157571:10	But you probably pay more *ICH*-1 percentage wise in other taxes . E_S
157579:110	one of the democratic candidates had a proposal for * doing away with all \[ the , \+ the \] tax codes 0 they have *T*-1 now and implementing \[ a f- , \+ I think a flat \] percentage , something like that . E_S
157599:25	Based on that , who do you think 0 you 're talking to *T*-1 , E_S
157613:23	\[ I , \+ I \] believe 0 \[ that 's a , \+ \] \[ for , \+ for \] civil suits it 's not unanimous , right , E_S
157616:13	I do n't know if it *EXP*-1 's even true that it 's always unanimous because I thought 0 there were cases \[ where , \+ uh , I do n't know if it 's the difference between felonies and misdemeanors , but where \] it *EXP*-2 was okay for a state to have it like eleven out of twelve *T*-3 . E_S
157616:59	I do n't know if it *EXP*-1 's even true that it 's always unanimous because I thought 0 there were cases \[ where , \+ uh , I do n't know if it 's the difference between felonies and misdemeanors , but where \] it *EXP*-2 was okay for a state to have it like eleven out of twelve *T*-3 .

E_S
157619:11	I actually thought 0 I 'd read that , too E_S
157627:15	but I do n't know what \[ the , \+ the \] laws , N_S
157628:10	do you think that that 's an unreasonable , uh , requirement that they be unanimous ? E_S
157631:30	And \[ I , \+ I \] do n't think 0 it *EXP*-1 would be wrong * to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if , you know , six or seven voted * not guilty , then instead of it being a hung jury , that was an acquittal . E_S
157631:50	And \[ I , \+ I \] do n't think 0 it *EXP*-1 would be wrong * to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if , you know , six or seven voted * not guilty , then instead of it being a hung jury , that was an acquittal . E_S

157632:15	But I do n't know whether you need \[ an , \+ a \] unanimous , uh , vote of not guilty *-1 to acquit . E_S
157637:149	, I mean , \[ it , \+ it \] fundamentally changes the way 0 the processing occurs *T*-2 because , uh , \[ the fact that it 's w- , \+ \[ the , \+ the \] principle is that the fact that it 's \] unanimous insures the beyond a reasonable doubt , uh , criterion that it , uh , increases \[ the , \+ the \] likelihood of * getting the proper judgment . E_S
157638:27	So , \[ I , \+ I \] think , 0 if anything , it would have *-1 to be a very close to unanimous decision . E_S
157645:26	actually \[ I , \+ I \] thought that that would be very interesting thing 0 * to do *T*-1 . E_S
157659:11	I also think 0 that would be really good . E_S
157662:24	Well , the people 0 I know *T*-1 who *T*-2 have served have said that usually what *T*-3 ends up *-4 happening is that , you know , after initially * finding out where people stand *T*-5 , that the whole deliberation usually results , if there is \[ a , \+ you know , something like a \] nine , three \[ or , \+ or \] more severe \[ and , \+ and \] the people in the majority trying *-6 to convince the minority that they 're right E_S
157662:91	Well , the people 0 I know *T*-1 who *T*-2 have served have said that usually what *T*-3 ends up *-4 happening is that , you know , after initially * finding out where people stand *T*-5 , that the whole deliberation usually results , if there is \[ a , \+ you know , something like a \] nine , three \[ or , \+ or \] more severe \[ and , \+ and \] the people in the majority trying *-6 to convince the minority that they 're right E_S

157666:23	and in fact , I 'm not sure that that 's any more , uh , liable *-1 to get rid *-2 of the reasonable doubt \[ than , \+ than \] anything else . E_S
157668:41	Well , \[ the , \+ the \] one thing that I know 0 *T*-1 does seem *-2 to happen from people 0 I 've talked to *T*-3 on this , is that in the situation 0 you just said *T*-4 where it 's nine to three , or some such number *T*-5 , \[ that there 's , an effect 0 *T*-7 starts *-8 being \+ that there 's starts *-6 being \] a lot of peer pressure going on E_S

157672:31	and \[ that \+ that , \] uh , peer pressure , N_S

157676:27	I 'd read one book , I think 0 it was calls *-1 TRIAL BY JURY of all things , that , uh *T*-2 went through and interviewed a bunch of jurors in some of the big cases , and in many cases *-3 looking \[ at what *T*-4 had , \+ \] at the evidence afterwards as to whether the decision was right , went back to the jurors , uh , based on the deliberations .

157683:31	Some of them did say that , you know , when they were the only one left * opposing the verdict *T*-1 , uh , you know , everyone was getting on them \[ so , \+ so \] heavily that eventually they just gave in *-4 knowing that nothing 0 they could do *T*-2 could stop it from * either being the verdict 0 everyone else was trying for *T*-3 or a hung jury because the one vote does n't mean anything except the ability * to not have a verdict .

158977:13	I ca n't believe that E_S
158982:8	You know what I mean *T*-1 ? E_S
159024:12	Well \[ maybe , \+ maybe \] you can figure out how we can stop this inertia that *T*-1 's , MUMBLEx come *-3 rolling towards , whatever it 's rolling toward *T*-2 *T*-4 . E_S

159031:18	Actually , I do n't think 0 we are *?* . E_S
159034:13	I do n't think so either . E_S
159036:46	Um , \[ like , \+ like \] Europe , um , England . I know 0 the taxes are a lot higher . E_S
159050:17	And , um , I know 0 I was reading in the paper I believe yesterday that , um , they 're talking , N_S
159050:46	And , um , I know 0 I was reading in the paper I believe yesterday that , um , they 're talking , N_S
159051:7	or maybe it was on the radi- , N_S
159091:13	I do n't know , N_S
159093:35	We do n't really have any vacation or , you know , sick days or health care or anything really E_S
159112:28	and they \[ pay for \+ you know , pay for \] the classes . E_S
159121:24	Uh , they do that I think 0 *T*-1 if you 're , uh , research MUMBLEx here E_S
159122:11	then I know of some of the people that *T*-1 have gotten their masters E_S
159123:10	and I think that , um , they might , you know , pay for that . Pay for the classes and stuff E_S
159123:27	and I think that , um , they might , you know , pay for that . Pay for the classes and stuff E_S
159123:37	and I think that , um , they might , you know , pay for that . Pay for the classes and stuff E_S
159127:10	but I know 0 \[ they let you , \+ they 'll let you \] decrease how many hours you work *T*-1 by MUMBLEx kind of percentage . E_S
159128:10	You know , they 'll let you work halftime \[ if you want *-1 to , \+ if you want *-2 to \] finish , E_S
159138:15	and then , I think 0 of course \[ you get like a , \+ with your extra degrees you get a \] pay raise due E_S
159139:13	so that will probably help out . E_S
159148:30	So \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know \[ in , \+ in \] terms of other things , other benefits other than sort of monetary E_S
159149:26	\[ I 'd , \+ you know , I , \] N_S
159154:23	We have *-1 to contribute a certain amount , uh , to it . E_S
159158:58	And it 's kind of split *-1 between C M U \[ and , \+ and , \] you know , the employee . E_S
159164:8	I think , I mean 0 \[ that 's pretty , \+ that 's a pretty \] important , uh , part of it there because \[ that , \+ that \] can be really expensive if you ever have any health problems . E_S
159167:22	\[ My dad , \+ I think 0 my , \] N_S
159189:32	Well , \[ the only , \+ \[ I think 0 the , \+ I guess 0 the \] only \] real , um , benefit I guess 0 you could say \[ working , for me \+ *-1 working here , \] besides I mean N_S

159220:100	\[ I have , \+ so I have \] *-1 to take that into consideration when I evaluate like how much I get paid *-5 *T*-2 real *T*-3 , you know , because if I was working somewhere else I 'd have *-4 to , you know , pay an extra five percent , or so . E_S

159235:93	the other thing that they allow you to do *T*-1 here while you are working \[ is , \+ is \] *-2 consult for , um , you know , other companies . E_S
159239:62	Um , so \[ that 's , \+ that \] kind of helps out in terms of , you know , * keeping up-to-date with contacts in industry . E_S

159246:34	You know , \[ in case , \+ you know , in case \] you ever need *-1 to bail out . E_S
159252:94	See \[ around , \+ around \] here it 's like , uh , N_S we pretty much work from project to project \[ on , \+ well , you know , with \] different sponsors . E_S
159256:52	\[ There 's not , \+ there is not \] a whole lot of , you know , funded research from , N_S
159263:10	and I know 0 in England the judges set all of the awards . E_S
159264:10	You know juries will decide the guilt or innocence , E_S
159266:10	And I think 0 maybe that avoids some of these totally ridiculous , you know , like millions and millions of dollars . E_S
159266:17	And I think 0 maybe that avoids some of these totally ridiculous , you know , like millions and millions of dollars . E_S

159270:23	\[ That , \+ that \] seems *-1 to make sense E_S
159271:41	but * leave it up to the more experienced person who *T*-1 knows how it fits *T*-2 into the , uh , kind of the rate for different MUMBLEx . N_S
159274:63	Each individual jury really does n't have any perception of what , um , \[ the going , \+ you know , if you will *?* the going , \] uh , award should be *T*-1 for a certain type of case , you know , within some kind of range . E_S

159284:10	You know , they 're not going *-1 to sit there and lose money . E_S
159294:61	And , uh , granted 0 some people need *-1 to be compensated *-2 if they have really been wronged *-3 , you know . E_S
159294:74	And , uh , granted 0 some people need *-1 to be compensated *-2 if they have really been wronged *-3 , you know . E_S
159299:10	Do you think 0 the jury should have a dollar figure for * losing an arm , a dollar figure for * losing different body parts ? E_S
159301:13	I do n't know . E_S
159302:10	You know some of the health insurance is written *-1 that way . You know , that , uh , if you buy an accident and death or dismemberment policy , you know , it s- , pre specified in the policy so much E_S

159303:15	but I do n't know that you can necessarily put \[ a , \+ a \] value *ICH*-3 on somebody 's limb , uh , arbitrarily that *T*-1 is always going *-2 to fit in all cases . E_S
159307:8	I think 0 maybe you look at , uh , the age of the person and their station in life \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , how much longer *ICH*-2 they have *T*-1 of work years that they would have *-3 to put up , you know , \[ with , \+ with \] that *T*-4 . E_S

159308:13	I mean maybe you do n't award an eighty-five year old guy the same thing that you would award a twenty-one year old *T*-1 . E_S
159312:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 it has *-1 to be some kind of common sense applied * there . E_S
159313:10	And there may be where the judiciary is a little more learned about that type of thing *T*-2 because they can be schooled *-1 in that kind of thing , E_S
159317:34	and that can be part of continuing education *ICH*-1 , maybe for judges . E_S
159321:13	I do n't know . . E_S
159325:10	You know , * to get into the economics of things , uh , N_S
159326:96	because if they wheel somebody into a courtroom and the jury 's heart goes out to that person and they do one of these mega awards , it really , you know , ultimately is not penalizing the person that they 're trying *T*-1 for get away . E_S
159333:25	If it 's a company , you know that they 're insured .
159333:38	If it 's a company , you know that they 're insured .
159338:8	I think 0 those should be uninsurable . E_S
159339:8	I think 0 those should have *-1 to be paid *-2 by the corporation itself \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-3 did the damage . E_S
159355:25	\[ For , \+ for \] honest mistakes where they 've done something \[ and , \+ and \] something happens *T*-1 . E_S

159377:15	and he pushes the wrong button E_S
159410:37	So again , it never really penalizes , the company doing the wrong . E_S
159419:29	And \[ if , \+ if \] they know 0 some practice is wrong , you know , N_S
159419:44	And \[ if , \+ if \] they know 0 some practice is wrong , you know , N_S
159419:54	And \[ if , \+ if \] they know 0 some practice is wrong , you know , N_S
159421:37	I 'm talking more about \[ the , \+ you know , the \] thing that they know *T*-1 , E_S

159430:11	Then I think 0 they ought *-1 to have *-2 to pay something out of their own pocket . E_S

159550:102	Either that or they 're just so understaffed that they ca n't afford *-2 to put in the , uh , care that they need *T*-1 . Cause it 's , you know , N_S

159583:50	We just , uh , moved my grandfather into , not a nursing home but , you know , a transitional type facility . E_S
159596:14	And , you know , the rest of the housekeeping and other meals a day are up to him . E_S

159851:35	My mom likes like , uh , Doris Day , you know . E_S

160021:92	we have one of those * use it or lose it plans *ICH*-1 , too , where , uh , they 'll basically pay for , uh , you know , child care type , uh , expenses *T*-2 . E_S

160024:23	That 's pretty good , you know . E_S
160029:8	I know that , like , \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the \] one plan that everyone seems *-1 to be in *T*-2 , in my place is , uh , you know , \[ you , \+ uh , * think 0 you \] call it *RNR*-3 plan D . E_S

160631:8	they might give you a little blurbs like this happened or that happened E_S
160636:24	Uh , but most of my news probably comes from NEWSWEEK E_S
160638:40	the news is n't , like , immediate what you 'd generally think of *T*-1 as news , E_S

160670:8	you may find one little , uh , news item interesting E_S

160799:13	I do n't think 0 anybody pays too little . E_S
160803:8	I think that we 're all paying a little bit too much taxes and not seeing too much good come out of it . E_S

160880:102	Oh , \[ \[ I , \+ I mean , I , \] \+ I 'd \] consider twenty percent lucky because \[ just on , \+ I mean , you know , when you figure out just on \] feds *T*-1 , you know , I actually hit the thirty-one bracket this year , which *T*-2 was no fun . E_S

161435:10	So I think 0 a person could work , uh , into the seventies , eighties , even nineties for that matter , E_S
161458:75	but , uh , \[ the , \+ the , \] uh , basic point of heavy metal \[ w- , \+ which \] *T*-1 seems *-2 to be music 0 *T*-3 to annoy you , \[ is , \+ uh , gets \] a little annoying . E_S
161467:91	Uh , lot of stuff that *T*-1 actually has , uh , ended up *-2 becoming popular like , uh , Nirvana and , uh , oh , you know , N_S
161473:76	Uh , R E M makes me laugh because they 've gone from a college radio progressive group to *-1 being , uh , you know , ultra mainstream at this point , E_S
161478:59	it 's , a lot of people \[ l- , \+ like , \] saying that , you know , bands in that position , you know , sold out . E_S
161478:84	it 's , a lot of people \[ l- , \+ like , \] saying that , you know , bands in that position , you know , sold out . E_S
161482:8	I think 0 that 's pretty much , you know , bull . E_S
161482:33	I think 0 that 's pretty much , you know , bull . E_S
161493:14	but , you know , people have picked up on it . E_S
161498:8	I think 0 it is *?* . E_S
161502:31	Uh , for a while there , \[ music seemed * to really ha- , \+ popular music seemed *-1 to have , \] uh , not a lot of point to it . E_S

161526:11	I 'm sure 0 \[ \[ that , \+ that so- , \] \+ that sold \] a lot for him . E_S

161549:30	\[ I can , \+ I can \] believe that . E_S
161580:10	You know , \[ we 're , \+ we 're , \] much better off *-1 playing , uh , Beethoven 's ninth , E_S
161583:21	that 's right , you know , E_S
161585:14	and everyone will know it \[ and \+ and \] hum it E_S
161592:99	Uh , I feel \[ \[ that , \+ uh , that , \] \+ that \] music should take chances in one way or another and that , uh , you know , if you 've heard a piece , oh , \[ a hundred , \+ a hundred \] times , N_S
161808:36	Well , actually , \[ I , \+ I 've \] known how * to sail *T*-1 pretty much my whole life . E_S
161819:76	\[ it , \+ it 's \] kind of a thing where you get the hang of it after a while , you know , uh , just kind of get a feel for the wind and how it works *T*-1 \[ and , \+ and \] the physics behind it *T*-2 . E_S
161824:48	it 's pretty easy 0 * to get the hang of *T*-1 , I think 0 *T*-2 E_S
161825:53	and , uh , generally , everybody 0 \[ I 've , \+ I 've \] known *T*-1 has kind of gotten into it , E_S
161826:29	but some people are more motorboaters , you know which *T*-1 is fine . E_S
161836:27	but , then , again , \[ they may \[ nev- , \+ m- , \] \+ they may never \] have tried anything like , uh , catamaran E_S
161836:56	but , then , again , \[ they may \[ nev- , \+ m- , \] \+ they may never \] have tried anything like , uh , catamaran E_S
161840:57	and , uh , that 's when you really start *-1 getting into speed *T*-2 . You know , E_S
161842:23	they get so fast , you know . E_S
161844:13	I did n't know that . E_S
161872:41	so he usually goes on one of the Great Lakes , I think 0 *T*-1 , and does his sailing .
161875:53	and there 's a lot of places there 0 you can go *T*-1 , you know . E_S
161907:21	they have a , you know , worldwide , N_S
161943:10	Do you think that there 's any way that , uh , N_S

161954:39	Uh , well , uh , out of control , I do n't know . E_S
161960:19	and , uh , you know , we get \[ c- , \+ cars \] on our block , uh , regularly , uh , uh , \[ g- , \+ uh , gone \] through *-1 , rifled through *-1 and stuff . E_S
161974:8	You know . E_S
161983:18	I mean , it seems like \[ \[ our , \+ our , \] \+ the \] prison systems , we ca n't seem *-1 to decide whether or not it 's a reform system or penal system . E_S

162079:58	\[ But , \+ but \] the point \[ that \+ \] was , that it , you know , N_S

162587:31	\[ and , \+ and , \] uh , he seems really , really happy with \[ the , \+ the \] set up . E_S
162594:16	In fact , I know a guy who *T*-1 works at Andover \[ who *T*-2 used * to work , \+ who I used *-4 to work \] with *T*-5 out here E_S
162635:13	Uh , it seems *-2 to be that , uh , gang warfare follows very rapidly on the heels of poverty conditions . E_S
162645:20	interestingly enough , I do n't think 0 we have here , \[ a , \+ a \] lot of gangs , but , uh , \[ only a couple , uh of , \+ not a whole large group of \] them , but , uh , just a few . Most of them centered * around , uh , drug territory . E_S
162681:13	uh , I think 0 they call it car jacking around here . E_S
162712:25	and , uh , of course , the mayor , uh , of D C is having a real problem , uh , * trying *-1 to , N_S
162715:13	I do n't know \[ what , \+ what \] the solution is *T*-1 . E_S
162729:120	Uh , course \[ the , \+ the \] reason \[ that , \+ that \] these kids tend *-2 \[ to , \+ to \] turn toward the drugs and everything else *T*-4 \[ s- , \+ seems \] *-3 to be just , you know , \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the \] end results \[ of , \+ of \] poverty \[ and , \+ and \] parents that *T*-1 are n't doing any parenting and everything else E_S
162729:146	Uh , course \[ the , \+ the \] reason \[ that , \+ that \] these kids tend *-2 \[ to , \+ to \] turn toward the drugs and everything else *T*-4 \[ s- , \+ seems \] *-3 to be just , you know , \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the \] end results \[ of , \+ of \] poverty \[ and , \+ and \] parents that *T*-1 are n't doing any parenting and everything else E_S
162733:24	because , I mean , you know , the parents are n't making a living at anything . E_S
162747:17	and , uh , I think , uh , 0 to a large extent , they do n't understand the concept that what they 're doing *T*-3 is actually illegal because this is the way 0 they were raised *-1 *T*-2 . E_S
162750:15	but it 's not wrong because all their friends do it . E_S
162754:7	so maybe it 's the law that *T*-1 wrong in their eyes E_S
162754:30	so maybe it 's the law that *T*-1 wrong in their eyes E_S
162759:17	so , I do n't know , E_S
162763:11	Well I think that the drug thing would actually be relatively easy 0 * to solve *T*-1 in terms \[ of , \+ of \] an actual solution to the problem .
162779:20	and I used *-1 to think that this whole argument was completely bogus , E_S
162780:26	but then , the more 0 I thought about it *T*-1 , the more sense it made *T*-2 , is that , uh , alcohol is as bad a drug as anything else . E_S
162804:61	Well , \[ I was , \+ I was , \] uh , originally chosen *-1 primarily , I think 0 *T*-2 , because I was a young fellow E_S

162820:13	I do n't know , E_S
162822:57	But , there , too , there are also cases in which I feel 0 a majority rule might be acceptable *T*-1 , particularly , I think in civil cases . E_S
162822:82	But , there , too , there are also cases in which I feel 0 a majority rule might be acceptable *T*-1 , particularly , I think in civil cases . E_S
162824:20	but in civil cases , I think 0 a majority rule \[ by , \+ by \] jury would be sufficient . E_S
162826:49	Well , uh , could you give me an example of a case where you think that *T*-1 ? E_S
162828:44	Well , in a criminal case , say one in which , you know , there is , like , say assault or some such *T*-1 . I think 0 there ought *-2 to be a unanimous , uh , vote because by law and by constitution there must be proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this . E_S

I think 0 there ought *-2 to be a unanimous , uh , vote because by law and by constitution there must be proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this . E_S
162829:25	And in civil law there , you know , is such a thing as like , * let 's say , uh , misappropriations or misuse of financial instruments or something like that . E_S
162830:19	A majority rule , I think 0 *T*-1 , would be more in line as there is no real smoking gun in the civil cases . E_S
162831:13	I do n't know if I 'm making any sense or not . E_S
162833:23	Well , I mean , I think , N_S
162840:22	and also , too , N_S I think 0 \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] tempering this and the fact that the consequences are much more , uh , serious in a criminal case . E_S
162842:15	Well , do you think \[ that , \+ that \] in a civil case , if there was majority rule , that it *EXP*-2 would be easy for someone to be set *-1 up ? E_S
162844:32	Um , well , I really ca n't say for certain , truth be known *-1 . E_S
162844:44	Um , well , I really ca n't say for certain , truth be known *-1 . E_S
162847:10	You know , I do n't know \[ for , \+ if \] you 're familiar with that or not . E_S
162847:23	You know , I do n't know \[ for , \+ if \] you 're familiar with that or not . E_S
162858:23	Well , I mean , I think that there are many cases in our judicial system where justice is not served *-2 *T*-1 . E_S
162865:13	and I also think , just like you were talking about *ICH*-1 before , why you were chosen *-3 to be on a jury *T*-2 that , uh , \[ \[ the , \+ just , \] \+ the \] process of * picking jurors is not always objective . E_S
162867:10	Oh , certainly not , E_S
162868:4	certainly not . E_S
162869:14	And , you know , they like *-1 to think that they 're getting someone who *T*-2 's objective in all this , E_S

162871:10	You know , the , N_S
162875:61	and then \[ you , \+ you 're \] either challenged *-2 which *T*-1 is , N_S you know ,
162877:12	or , I think 0 it 's a limit now , E_S
162878:8	they probably have a limit now , E_S
162889:29	\[ \[ I guess , \+ I think , \] \+ uh , I wonder \] if that worked . E_S
162895:8	I think 0 it usually does . E_S
162896:8	You might try , uh , E_S
162897:13	I do n't know , E_S
162908:8	It seemed like it did , E_S
162909:10	but it might not *?* . E_S
162983:23	\[ I , \+ I \] know 0 a lot of people around here sometimes have , like , mothers or grandmothers that *T*-1 take care of their kids E_S

163002:19	and , uh , you know , colds and things like that get spread *-1 real easy and things , E_S
163007:61	and , course , there 's a lot of different types of day care available *ICH*-2 , too , you know , where they teach them academic things *T*-1 . E_S

163039:8	I think 0 it would be kind of stressful . E_S

163044:30	but , uh , * seems like , you know , N_S
163046:23	what if he cried at the wrong time E_S

163151:109	\[ I- , \+ if \] they did it with \[ the , \+ uh , just the \] judges , the police have *-1 to do a lot better job of *-2 making * sure that their evidence is airtight E_S
163152:47	because the judges sitting in that kind of stuff day after day , they know all the procedures , E_S
163153:8	they know what *T*-1 's good and what *T*-2 is n't *?* , E_S
163155:39	you ca n't use this as , uh , evidence , you know , because it was either illegally obtained *-1 or whatever E_S
163156:14	and , you know , you would n't have this , uh , uh , theatrics where the lawyer jumps up and presents it \[ to the , \+ to the \] jury *T*-1 E_S
163160:40	any jury 's not going *-1 to disregard the evidence , you know . E_S
163163:38	\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] think 0 our judicial system is attorney welfare myself . E_S
163165:8	That may very well be . E_S
163186:16	So where do you think 0 they target their efforts *T*-1 ? E_S
163197:10	You know , that 's a , N_S
163207:8	I think , 0 * to begin with , \[ you would h- , \+ you would have , \] N_S
163214:8	I think 0 somehow you have *-1 to separate the revenues from , N_S
163216:15	Well , you know , uh , * talking about the lawyers , you know what *T*-1 might very well \[ do , \+ uh , cause \] \[ a , \+ uh , a \] drop in the number of lawyers and things like that , is * to set the fees for cases . E_S
163216:47	Well , you know , uh , * talking about the lawyers , you know what *T*-1 might very well \[ do , \+ uh , cause \] \[ a , \+ uh , a \] drop in the number of lawyers and things like that , is * to set the fees for cases . E_S

163219:70	and if he gets in there and starts *-1 rooting around and finds something in there that *T*-2 's really tremendously wrong with it , then he eats it . E_S
163221:36	Now , if he comes in and says , you know , I 'll repair \[ your , \+ your \] V C R , or somebody else 's V C R , for a hundred dollars , gets in there , N_S maybe it 's a blown fuse , E_S
163221:124	Now , if he comes in and says , you know , I 'll repair \[ your , \+ your \] V C R , or somebody else 's V C R , for a hundred dollars , gets in there , N_S maybe it 's a blown fuse , E_S
163225:9	So , maybe if we did that with the lawyers , so that , you know , whether it 's a murder case or \[ \[ a , \+ you know , a civil , \] \+ uh , somebody suing somebody else , \] you get X dollars for that case E_S
163225:47	So , maybe if we did that with the lawyers , so that , you know , whether it 's a murder case or \[ \[ a , \+ you know , a civil , \] \+ uh , somebody suing somebody else , \] you get X dollars for that case E_S
163225:94	So , maybe if we did that with the lawyers , so that , you know , whether it 's a murder case or \[ \[ a , \+ you know , a civil , \] \+ uh , somebody suing somebody else , \] you get X dollars for that case E_S
163228:16	Now , I firmly believe in that E_S
163249:48	Um , \[ \[ y- , \+ well , you , \] \+ you know , you 're \] talking to part of them that *T*-1 's paying for that . E_S
163255:10	You know \[ \[ \[ that 's , \+ it , \] \+ it 's , \] \+ it 's \] amazing E_S
163260:8	I think 0 *-1 to really correct the judicial system , you have *-1 to get the lawyers out of it . E_S
163272:17	I do n't \[ know , \+ really know \] that much about the recycling in this area that we 're in *T*-1 . E_S
163272:28	I do n't \[ know , \+ really know \] that much about the recycling in this area that we 're in *T*-1 . E_S
163280:21	fact as far as I know , the school *ICH*-1 does n't have any kind of programs or anything out here . \[ And , \+ uh , or \] the grocery store or anything in this area , E_S
163289:8	I think 0 at each Wal-Mart , they had some recycling dumpsters and things like that , which *T*-1 now , N_S
163299:8	They seem *-1 to be having a real good response . E_S
163307:10	and I know in the state 0 we were from *T*-1 that they did that \[ t- , \+ similar \] type thing . E_S
163308:40	The city \[ \[ brought \+ ought , \] \+ you know , set \] \[ tr- , \+ separate trash \] cans E_S

163315:16	I do n't really know . E_S
163319:16	I do n't really know , E_S
163325:11	I just know that , uh , my in-laws \[ up in , \+ up in \] Oklahoma , that 's how \[ they do , \+ you know , they pick \] it up *T*-1 , E_S
163325:92	I just know that , uh , my in-laws \[ up in , \+ up in \] Oklahoma , that 's how \[ they do , \+ you know , they pick \] it up *T*-1 , E_S
163326:15	but I do n't know if they \[ get a , \+ get anything \] back on it E_S
163341:10	You know , all kinds of bottles \[ \[ they , \+ they , \] \+ they \] really charge people \[ * to , \+ \] I guess 0 *T*-3 when you purchase them *T*-2 \[ and , \+ and then \] when you turn them back in *T*-1 . E_S
163353:9	So , maybe that 's one thing 0 they can do *T*-1 . E_S
163355:8	I think now 0 they 're a lot more expensive than that . E_S
163356:64	Uh , I bought some Cokes *ICH*-1 the other day in \[ the br- , \+ the little bottles \] you know , E_S
163360:15	and \[ I think 0 the bottles were \+ like , I know 0 they were \] at least ten cents apiece . E_S

163362:43	I was like , God , how much were those bottles *T*-1 you know ? E_S
163366:93	And , \[ it was , \+ they come \] in like , uh , \[ eight \[ and , \+ and \] \+ eight and \] ten packs , you know instead of six packs E_S
163371:10	You know , I was like God Almighty , E_S
163371:26	You know , I was like God Almighty , E_S
163379:28	It 's pretty dangerous out there , you know , when they fall over *T*-1 , E_S
163395:13	Now , I know that like Minyard 's and places like that around like Arlington and Fort Worth and a lot of those grocery stores , they have like four different bins *ICH*-1 out front . Uh , different colors for different things \[ and , \+ and \] things like that , E_S
163402:28	but \[ I , \+ I \] do know 0 some of these places were doing that E_S
163423:13	I do n't know , E_S
163425:42	it *EXP*-1 's not as easy *ICH*-2 , * selecting , you know , clean junk as they say *?* . E_S
163447:18	Oh , \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 two or three minutes is fine . E_S
163447:29	Oh , \[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 two or three minutes is fine . E_S
163522:28	because they 're at a higher risk of exposure E_S
163524:25	and \[ I , \+ I \] think that drugs , N_S
163531:10	But I think 0 it 's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have *-1 to exercise some quick judgment in the field . E_S
163539:30	so the clients are very concerned that , you know , the engineers who *T*-1 go out there are adhering to their drug policy , because they 're on \[ their , \+ their , \] you know , territory and everything , E_S

163676:13	I do n't know . E_S
163682:63	\[ \[ that , \+ that histor- , \] \+ for some reason , historical sites \] with , you know , \[ the , \+ the \] full federal money and everything seem *-1 to appear \[ \[ as , \+ as \] \+ almost as \] like political favors \[ to , \+ to \] very strong politicians . E_S

163685:150	\[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's , \] \+ it 's \] funny because , uh , it was one of the things that Bush is trying really hard *-1 to get ahold of *T*-2 is the line item veto where , uh , you know , Congress is able *-3 to attach all kinds of , uh , funny amendments for individual , uh , \[ c- , \+ congressional \] districts \[ to the , \+ to the \] main budget proposals *T*-4 E_S
163691:43	So , it sounds like \[ you , \+ uh , you \] think \[ that , \+ that \] we 'd be able *-1 to save some money by , uh *-2 passing the line item veto . E_S
163696:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 the line item veto \[ is \[ not , \+ not , \] \+ is not \] necessarily a bad thing , * assuming that \[ \[ the , \+ uh , the , \] \+ the \] President , uh , uses it *-2 to get rid *-1 of , uh , this kind of waste . E_S

163718:8	I know 0 state governors usually have line item vetos E_S
163720:25	and , uh , when Dukakis vetoed certain things *T*-1 , there was a big uproar and was n't necessarily so popular . E_S
163729:23	I mean , I do n't know , E_S
163749:13	Uh , I know some , N_S
163753:23	Uh , well , I do n't know exactly what *T*-1 's hot down in Texas . E_S
163754:8	I know what *T*-1 's hot down here with me , E_S

163775:105	I 'm more , uh , old rock and roll , uh , some \[ new , \+ newer , \] I guess 0 you would call it *ICH*-1 heavy metal rock and roll type you know , uh , Van Halen , that kind of thing . E_S
163798:34	they started *-1 getting a little more , you know , N_S
163805:57	But , uh , some of their older \[ s- , \+ stuff \] was , uh , you know , quite enjoyable to me . E_S

163828:11	I 'm sure 0 there 's a lot of that down there . E_S
163851:8	I think 0 some of them , the artists are even , uh , hitting the pop charts . E_S

163857:54	\[ it 's , \+ music is \] kind of going an odd direction nowadays , I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S

164098:118	and , \[ they could , \+ uh , they could \] get in pretty easy \[ and , \+ and \] especially , uh , since there are bedrooms upstairs and people leave the door open , you know , while they 're upstairs *-1 playing music , E_S
164112:15	but I did n't know that they had been watching me E_S
164114:84	and the first thing 0 they said *T*-3 is , uh , you must do n't have *-1 to be to work at eight , you know , E_S
164140:12	so , I think about , uh , *-1 sprucing that up in a couple years if I can *?* . E_S
164148:19	\[ What do you think 0 you 'll , \+ uh , what kind of a car do you think 0 you 'll \] buy *T*-1 next ? E_S

164150:34	Well , since I just turned forty , I 'm thinking about a forty year old man 's car , \[ something , \+ uh , something \] real sporty E_S
164154:58	but , uh , realistically with , uh , the need * to take the kids to school , * probably have *-1 to have something that , uh , *T*-2 would n't wined up *-3 putting their knees this their throat when they sat in the back seat *T*-4 . E_S
164161:13	Well , I think 0 the next car 0 we get *T*-1 will probably be a ,
164161:45	Well , I think 0 the next car 0 we get *T*-1 will probably be a ,
164168:147	and , uh , whatever I get *T*-1 , I want *-2 to have , uh , air bags , uh , both driver 's and passenger side and four door because it 's much more convenient *ICH*-4 if you 're carrying anybody \[ to , \+ \] you know , rather than * have them stoop down *-3 to get over , E_S
164169:10	so I think 0 the four door is probably a major requirement E_S
164169:27	so I think 0 the four door is probably a major requirement E_S
164173:31	and , other than that , uh , you know , reasonable cost and safety and , uh , as much economy as you can get *?* out of a car . E_S
164174:15	Uh , you know , I 'm not looking for one with a great big engine , uh E_S
164180:25	and \[ it , \+ that \] seems *-1 to be just fine . E_S
164181:8	I know 0 \[ they s- , \+ they 're coming \] out with some V eight now E_S

164210:27	Uh , not really , uh , you know , E_S
164212:57	and I figure 0 if it 's so bad that I need a four wheel drive , I probably ought *-1 to be home anyway . E_S
164245:60	One of my sons has \[ a , \+ a \] Plymouth , uh , van or , you know , uh , uh , that same type of thing , the Voyager , I guess E_S
164254:38	and , of course , as he gets friends , I 'm sure 0 *T*-1 that will be even handier . E_S
164255:12	So , I know 0 \[ \[ if we were , \+ if we had kids still at home , \] \+ we 're in our fifties now , but , if we had kids still at home , \] we 'd certainly have *-1 to seriously consider a van just for their functional value . E_S

164273:58	uh , again , like you , if conditions \[ are , \+ are \] that bad , I probably do n't want *-1 to be driving anyway . E_S

164280:23	What kind of crime do you think , uh , 0 *T*-1 is the most prevalent in our society ? E_S
164282:15	Oh , boy , probably , uh , robberies , people stealing from each other . E_S
164288:59	That 's the most prevalent crime . Uh , \[ the ones that *T*-2 really , \+ you know , the ones that *T*-1 really \] add up after a while , I guess , you know , \[ from , s- , \+ far as \] insurance money and stuff like that , insurance costs . E_S

164319:18	I mean you know , those are n't , N_S
164328:18	Uh , when I think of crime *T*-1 , I think of stuff \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-2 affects other people like people getting , you know , killed or raped *-3 . E_S

164329:8	I think 0 rape is one of the worst crimes . E_S

164412:28	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't think 0 it 's \[ a , \+ so much of a \] deterrent \[ as , \+ as \] it is \[ \[ a , \+ a good , \] \+ uh , a good \] way for vengeance , you know , for the relatives \[ and , \+ and \] family members , E_S

164502:8	I think 0 in some cases it *EXP*-1 does n't matter if it 's a deterrent or not . E_S
164509:29	I mean I mean , I 'm thinking of an extreme case like a serial murderer E_S
164523:8	I think 0 for serial murder it is warranted because if a person who *T*-1 would do something like that in cold blood , N_S
164545:15	And I do n't think \[ that , \+ that \] rehabilitation is effective . E_S

164574:15	huh . Do you think 0 they should be punished *-1 at all , or , uh , like go to prison , uh , E_S
164578:24	Uh , it is *?* to a certain extent E_S

164585:8	I know 0 they \[ put , \+ uh , put \] them in jail sometimes , I guess .
164588:8	I think in s- , N_S
164603:10	You know , now , I wonder what you think *T*-1 about this E_S
164603:34	You know , now , I wonder what you think *T*-1 about this E_S
164607:10	And I know that , uh , if somebody had done something to my family , I would feel that I had the right * \[ to , \+ to \] get revenge on them E_S
164608:51	\[ and , \+ uh , but , \] \[ I , \+ I \] do n't think 0 that 's done *-1 much anywhere . E_S
164611:13	Well , I think 0 that would be kind of drastic punishment . E_S
164620:19	But , one thing , I think that if there is a chance for rehabilitation then that chance \[ sh- , \+ should \] be investigated *-1 . E_S
164627:98	But , like I said , \[ if , \+ if \] someone \[ is , \+ is \] just pathologically going *-1 to murder people no matter what then I think 0 they should be eliminated *-2 from society . E_S
164645:31	There 's a lot of folks *ICH*-2 *ICH*-5 , probably , that *T*-1 are in prison \[ that , \+ uh , that \] *T*-4 are n't really a danger to society , huh , E_S
164654:5	probably more of them then the other way around . E_S
164657:6	not sure \] N_S
164659:13	I 'm not sure what kind of , uh , capital punishment we have *T*-1 here . E_S
164661:13	Well , I know 0 in North Carolina , we do have capital punishment . E_S
164669:24	so I can assume that you probably watch the T V news . E_S
164700:103	and \[ they have , \+ they have \] K C R W , which *T*-2 \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] saw a thing recently , they may be trying *-1 to start their own , uh , cable TV outlet , I guess . E_S
164773:42	Uh , if there 's something 0 you want *-1 to know *T*-2 , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] in the TIMES \[ and then , \+ \[ and \] in detail . E_S
164775:53	and then the HERALD EXAMINER collapsed about two years ago because of , oh , I do n't know , just nobody was buying it really . E_S
164781:38	Uh , there used *-1 to be , fact , I think 0 there still is *RNR*-3 , \[ the , \+ uh , the \] DAILY NEWS which *T*-2 runs out of the San Fernando Valley E_S
164784:57	and , uh , they 're not bad \[ as far as a , \+ uh , you know , as far as a \] local paper goes . E_S
164787:34	He was a really cool guy . Uh , you know , went to Columbia University and all this stuff . E_S
164789:19	but , uh , you know , \[ it 's not , \+ it 's not \] the TIMES . E_S
164793:25	Although \[ I , \+ you know , I 'm \] sorry *-1 to see some of their , uh , N_S

164825:41	And it 's just sort of \[ a , \+ \] you know , four or five pages that *T*-1 covers what *T*-2 's going on in Plano . E_S
164829:8	I know . E_S
164835:50	Oh , I would imagine 0 \[ \[ in , \+ uh , you know , in , \] \+ in \] Dallas they have plenty happening in Dallas 0 * to cover *T*-1 , that it *EXP*-2 gets hard * covering all of the \[ sub- , \+ suburbs \] E_S
164882:14	how do you think that , uh , the viewpoints differ *T*-1 ? E_S
164884:8	I think 0 a lot of it is just , uh , the fact that in the U S you 're so far removed *ICH*-1 , uh , in a lot of cases from , say , conflicts E_S
164891:64	\[ It 's , \+ B B C \[ \[ is , \+ uh , oh , I do n't know the right word , is , \] \+ is \] \] almost , uh , N_S
164897:8	they seem *-1 to give more of just the facts than opinions . E_S
164899:10	Do you think , then , that , uh , the American media is presenting an opinion along with their facts ? E_S
164903:25	and \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 a lot of it *ICH*-1 is *?* , uh , especially T V news , E_S
164907:32	I mean , \[ I , \+ you know , I \] think 0 it *EXP*-1 's important * to interpret it , E_S
164907:43	I mean , \[ I , \+ you know , I \] think 0 it *EXP*-1 's important * to interpret it , E_S
164920:16	uh , I always think 0 it 's humorous \[ when , \+ when \] the President gives the State of the Union \[ and , \+ \] uh , for thirty minutes E_S and then for an hour and a half you hear different commentators explaining what you just heard *T*-1 *T*-2 . E_S
164927:30	So \[ I , \+ overall , I \] think 0 I would rather *-1 hear just straight reporting . E_S
164932:62	but people were really down on him for * reporting the fact that , \[ th- , \+ you know , this \] is n't a baby milk factory , E_S
164934:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 \[ that , \+ that \] to me showed that the Americans were really getting used to * having \[ the , \+ not just the \] facts , but also the conclusions and opinions spoon fed *-1 to them . E_S
164939:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 \[ people are , \+ people have \] that opinion . E_S
164964:22	I live in , you know , the real richy part , I guess 0 *T*-1 . E_S

164973:16	I do n't really think 0 that 's fair . You know . E_S
164973:39	I do n't really think 0 that 's fair . You know . E_S
164977:19	Uh , but , you know , I 'm happy with what they 're in *T*-1 , E_S
165000:24	but the difference in schools I think 0 *T*-1 was pretty substantial E_S
165004:35	and , uh , one of the things that *T*-1 probably would have been better \[ if , \+ \] is if the entire county \[ had had , \+ had \] just one school system . E_S
165009:32	because what *T*-1 was happening was , you know , 0 all the very rich people \[ went out to the , \+ move out to the \] suburbs E_S
165016:27	there was n't as many , you know , of the nice supplies in science class that we would have liked *T*-1 . E_S
165022:24	so \[ I , \+ you know , I \] think that \[ one of the things , \+ one of the ways \] 0 * \[ \[ to , \+ to , \] \+ to \] help schools in general , uh , and get them all to a minimum level \[ \[ of , \+ of , \] \+ of \] competency almost *T*-1 , would be * to expand the size of school districts so you get a wider variety of people , E_S

165033:10	you know , you can come to south Tyler where I live *T*-1 E_S
165043:12	and the parents might not could even tell you what their kid 's teacher 's name is *T*-1 . You know , E_S
165043:62	and the parents might not could even tell you what their kid 's teacher 's name is *T*-1 . You know , E_S
165047:66	uh , that has \[ a , \+ a \] whole lot 0 *T*-1 to do with it , you know , E_S
165048:57	as far as their learning , I mean , if the parents are n't , uh , you know , willing *-1 to go with the kids and find out what they 're learning *T*-2 and if they 're learning you know , they really do n't have much of a chance at all . E_S

165067:8	I know what they 're learning *T*-1 E_S
165068:44	and if they 're up , I call and find out , you know , E_S
165073:15	okay , you know , uh , E_S
165074:25	and \[ I , \+ I \] know kids that *T*-1 their parents could really give a rip E_S
165084:14	and , you know , eh , you know , I 'll get through the day , and , uh , bring homework home E_S
165084:29	and , you know , eh , you know , I 'll get through the day , and , uh , bring homework home E_S
165089:20	Uh , just , you know , \[ they , \+ they \] take a notion * to do it , E_S
165091:35	and , uh , that does n't work either , you know , E_S
165097:23	and there 's nothing , you know . E_S
165102:8	I know \[ \[ that \+ that , \] \+ that \] was a big factor for me . E_S
165108:91	* ended up *-1 getting some scholarships 0 * to go to college *T*-2 \[ and \+ \] \[ which *T*-3 has been , \+ you know , which *T*-4 is \] really nice , E_S
165112:10	and I think 0 the difference for me was that \[ \[ my parents were , \+ you know , they were definitely , \] \+ they were always \] there , E_S
165112:62	and I think 0 the difference for me was that \[ \[ my parents were , \+ you know , they were definitely , \] \+ they were always \] there , E_S
165135:22	But , uh , I do n't know , E_S
165144:30	and * say , well , I should have known better , E_S
165149:13	and it was probably made *-1 in China by slaves . E_S
165159:8	I think that , uh , aside from the fact 0 all markets being internationalized *-1 E_S
165168:11	It 's probably a Japanese *RNR*-1 or a Burmese *RNR*-1 company owning and hiring people in the U S . E_S
165175:91	They were talking about cars , uh , the car issue just came out . And about how , yeah , you 'd like *-1 to buy an American car maybe *T*-2 E_S
165179:19	but , uh , you know , the transmission may be made *-1 in Japan or whatever . E_S
165179:29	but , uh , you know , the transmission may be made *-1 in Japan or whatever . E_S
165184:24	\[ and , \+ and \] I know for a fact that the transmission is made *-1 by Mitsubishi . E_S
165188:10	You know , so it 's like , what are you going *-2 to do *T*-1 , you know ? E_S
165188:61	You know , so it 's like , what are you going *-2 to do *T*-1 , you know ? E_S
165194:13	I do n't know , E_S
165195:82	\[ I , \+ I \] personally feel that , uh , uh , if the Japanese cars are better and Americans buy them , you know , that 's the way 0 it goes *T*-1 E_S
165196:14	and , you know , people , \[ man- , \+ \] more than manufacturers should get a clue E_S
165197:14	and , you know , they should start *-1 making quality products . E_S
165200:8	I think 0 they 're beginning *-1 to . E_S
165204:19	That 's what I thought *T*-1 , too , until I saw the CONSUMER REPORTS issue . E_S
165208:81	Uh , they 've got \[ all the American , \+ well , \[ all the , \+ all the \] cars \] rated *-1 , you know , E_S
165211:15	There 's nothing wrong with them .
165216:8	I know . E_S
165225:22	But , uh , I do n't know , E_S
165226:9	\[ may- , \+ maybe \] they 're getting better , E_S

165227:5	maybe they 're starting *-1 to get a clue .
165231:8	It probably wo n't start *-1 really showing up until ninety-four or so . E_S
165235:46	Technology that *T*-1 comes in right now \[ is , \+ is \] probably not going *-2 to be \[ imple- , \+ implemented *-3 \] until , you know , quite a few years down the road . E_S

165242:30	because technology is so , uh , you know , volatile and changing all the time . E_S
165244:12	And can you think of any other industry where
165253:14	Or , uh , maybe I say , well , you know , you paid five hundred bucks for this program ,
165253:36	Or , uh , maybe I say , well , you know , you paid five hundred bucks for this program ,
165266:18	Uh , I do n't know . E_S
165275:33	they 're kind of the leaders right now , you know . E_S
165276:42	I used *-1 to see all those commercials for Windows , you know , E_S
165284:15	Yeah , you know . E_S
165289:36	almost is the key word , there , too , you know , because \[ \[ I , \+ I \] really , \+ I 've \] used both E_S
165302:22	But , uh , I do n't know , E_S
165343:61	But it *EXP*-2 's sort of like * surfing on the wave of future shock *-1 to you know , keep up with the changes as they happen . E_S
165349:37	Something that I find *T*-1 uncomfortable is , you know , 0 \[ you , \+ you \] want *-3 to buy something ,
165351:20	and you got *-1 to think about what kind of memory you want *-2 to get *T*-3 and what kind of technology that you want *-4 to go for *T*-5 , you know , E_S
165351:109	and you got *-1 to think about what kind of memory you want *-2 to get *T*-3 and what kind of technology that you want *-4 to go for *T*-5 , you know , E_S
165352:57	* \[ let , \+ let 's \] take the example , the modem for , you know , N_S
165358:15	Well , you know , it *EXP*-2 used *-1 to be that you get a twelve hundred ba- , N_S
165374:8	I know what *T*-1 needs *-2 to be done *-3 E_S
165375:10	and I know that the oil *ICH*-2 \[ needs , \+ should \] be changed *-1 very regularly and all of the bearings E_S
165381:7	or maybe it *EXP*-1 was thirty dollars * to do it E_S
165396:55	And they told me that \[ my , \+ my \] brake pads were gosh , you know , seventy percent still good , you know , E_S
165396:77	And they told me that \[ my , \+ my \] brake pads were gosh , you know , seventy percent still good , you know , E_S
165400:10	and I thought 0 that was a good deal . E_S
165409:24	\[ I 'm , \+ you might say 0 I 'm , \] uh , uh , good back yard mechanic E_S
165410:24	and \[ I , \+ you know , I \] took auto shop in high school , E_S
165413:26	but one thing 0 I did n't know *T*-1 is that when I was messing around with cars and stuff *T*-2 and most of the cars , N_S
165419:38	so I drove on those brake pads for , uh , you know , forty-five thousand miles E_S
165423:10	You know , they 've gotten to the point that \[ where \+ \] they do n't weigh very much *T*-1 E_S
165429:24	so \[ I , \+ you know , I \] just did it anyway . E_S
165431:10	You know , like I just kind of stay up on it E_S
165432:57	and then if you go and like , just about \[ any point , \+ any you know point \] in time and pull my dip stick and pull it out and look at the oil , the oil is you might say , uh , a white golden brown . E_S
165432:122	and then if you go and like , just about \[ any point , \+ any you know point \] in time and pull my dip stick and pull it out and look at the oil , the oil is you might say , uh , a white golden brown . E_S
165433:10	You know , it 's not dirty . E_S
165482:16	and , uh , probably about four months ago the water pump decided *-1 to go out . E_S
165520:14	and , you know , they 're very expensive . E_S
165522:60	Uh , \[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's kind of , \] \+ uh , you know , it 's kind of \] hard 0 * to explain *T*-1 . E_S
165526:39	We 've actually gone , uh , just recently , to you know \[ having , \+ *-1 having \] two checking accounts . E_S
165544:34	We just scramble through month to month , you know . E_S
165567:52	and one of these days I am going *-1 to do something about that I believe 0 *T*-2 . E_S
165572:8	You know how that goes *T*-1 , E_S
165575:43	\[ She , \+ uh she \] writes all the checks , you know , once a month . E_S
165607:24	And \[ we , \+ you know , we 've \] experimented \[ with , \+ with , \] uh , budgets , you know from time to time , uh , E_S
165607:76	And \[ we , \+ you know , we 've \] experimented \[ with , \+ with , \] uh , budgets , you know from time to time , uh , E_S
165608:19	but , if , you know , N_S
165641:79	and \[ we 've had , \+ uh , they 've always had , \] uh , where they match your funds *T*-1 , you know , E_S
165646:30	Uh , \[ that , \+ \] you know , we 've done that too . E_S
165660:19	but , uh , you know , I try *-1 to use that money for food \[ mo- , \+ \] E_S
165661:16	Jim gives me a certain amount money . E_S
165662:10	You know , we just transfer it into my account E_S
165669:35	and then with that I try and handle , you know , some of the clothes that the girls need *T*-1 and things like that , E_S
165680:61	* Just kind of play it by ear , but keep \[ the , \+ the \] deductions you know MUMBLEx . E_S
165694:15	Uh , you know . I am given *-1 so much \[ mon- , \+ money \] a month , E_S
165699:31	So , I try *-1 not to , you know , N_S
165700:28	\[ we do n't , \+ you know , I do n't \] ask for more . E_S
165706:11	Because I think 0 when you go to the grocery store *T*-1 , \[ you can just , \+ you can \] go crazy with all the choices that you have *T*-2 E_S
165746:101	You will see that all of a sudden \[ you 're paying , \+ you 're trying \] *-1 to decide whether you are going *-2 to do , you know , soccer and piano and all these choices that they have *T*-3 of activities 0 * to do *T*-4 E_S
165754:65	and then you really have *-1 to start *-2 saying okay , now what can we afford *T*-3 you know , E_S
165760:29	\[ and , \+ uh , but \] I think 0 when we were back at your age *T*-1 , we did n't have much of a budget E_S
165764:30	and then as the girls got older , I think 0 *T*-1 \[ we , \+ we \] did more and more of that . E_S
165765:10	You know , more budgeting \[ as \+ as \] they got older . E_S
165787:34	Well , \[ we just have , \+ you know , we have \] a good friend that *T*-1 's about *-2 to move to Atlanta . E_S
165794:18	I found , you know , 0 I feel a lot better . E_S
165795:10	You know , we use *-1 to work out of one check book E_S
165803:25	Now , I \[ have , \+ know \] exactly what I 'm spending *T*-1 E_S
165809:13	I do n't know a lot about them . E_S
165813:57	Actually that 's kind of the type of car that \[ I , \+ I 'm \] thinking about 0 we might get *T*-1 . E_S
165813:70	Actually that 's kind of the type of car that \[ I , \+ I 'm \] thinking about 0 we might get *T*-1 . E_S
165825:21	Uh , yet I do n't know \[ wh- , \+ whether \] I would buy Saturn or not at this point . E_S
165867:25	and I say , boy , you know , E_S
165874:39	And I find that for \[ a normal , \+ you know , everyday things . \] It 's really very easy 0 * to work on *T*-1 E_S
165875:22	and so , uh , you know , I 'm kind of spoiled . E_S
165887:14	and , you know , I want a car that I can work on *T*-1 because I think 0 it just costs too much * even to get the oil changed *-2 anymore . E_S
165887:58	and , you know , I want a car that I can work on *T*-1 because I think 0 it just costs too much * even to get the oil changed *-2 anymore . E_S
165891:56	And \[ \[ that 's kind of , \+ that 's , \] \+ that 's \] probably one thing 0 I 'd look at *T*-1 . E_S
165892:8	I think 0 another thing 0 I 'd look at *T*-1 is safety . E_S
165895:43	That 's one of the things that my wife and I have thought about *T*-1 . E_S
165901:27	That 's a real nice car , I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
165911:8	I think 0 \[ it 's very \+ , it 's a \] stylish car both inside and out . E_S
165931:13	Oh , I think \[ that , \+ That 's \] excellent . E_S
165938:46	Actually , \[ my , \+ my \] wife and I are actually \[ thinking , \+ contemplating \] *-1 buying a new car in the next year and a half or so . E_S
165939:29	So we 're actually been looking around and thinking about things . E_S
165944:18	oh , I do n't know . E_S
165946:47	A dealer return type thing on a ninety-two and ninety-three or something like that you know . E_S
165970:50	\[ Or , \+ or , \] of course , we 've already talked , you know , N_S
165975:13	I do n't think 0 you can get dual side air bags . E_S
166001:17	And then , you know , we kind of want a four door . E_S
166023:66	So a lot of the people who *T*-1 live up front do n't bother *-2 to recycle because , you know , it *EXP*-3 's too far * to carry the stuff to the other bins . E_S
166025:25	\[ \[ I , \+ I know 0 a lot , \] \+ I think 0 a lot \] of , uh , \[ the , \+ the \] issues with regard to recycling are that , uh , people have *-1 to be motivated *-2 \[ to do , \+ to do \] something like that because it does take extra effort . E_S

166027:26	\[ \[ and , \+ and I think that , \] \+ and I know \] 0 Massachusetts has , N_S
166027:45	\[ \[ and , \+ and I think that , \] \+ and I know \] 0 Massachusetts has , N_S
166030:35	and the majority of the incentive in * recycling bottles probably , * believe it or not , is just * to get the extra nickel at \[ the , uh , \+ the \] store and not , uh , N_S

166031:31	that 's the majority of people that I know of *T*-1 anyways . E_S
166032:28	Where people are n't really , you know , eco conscious *T*-3 . It 's just the fact that it 's something 0 they have *-2 to do *T*-1 . E_S
166043:85	And it 's going *-2 to create a lot more work for \[ the , uh , \+ the \] stores that *T*-1 sell , you know , sodas and stuff . E_S
166048:41	Uh , \[ and , \+ and \] matter of fact , I think 0 it took like three tries \[ t- , \+ for \] it to go through . E_S
166050:51	and people notice it as far as , uh , highways being , uh , you know , N_S
166053:64	so \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] been a ecologically sound policy \[ and , \+ \] you know , \[ as , \+ as \] far as * recycling your bottles in terms of trash and so forth . E_S
166055:28	And that 's the big thing , I think 0 *T*-3 , that \[ th- , \+ they \] try *-1 to promote *T*-2 . E_S
166058:8	I think 0 here \[ if they , \+ uh , instead of * just , you know , requiring that you \[ put , \+ put \] out the trash and stuff , if they *ICH*-2 \] could get some kind of rebate , those people who *T*-1 do put the stuff out , uh , you know , and separate it , have lower collection fee or something * may encourage people to separate .

E_S
166068:10	and I know that , \[ at w- , \+ where I work *T*-1 , \] N_S
166070:55	And there 's a big push on for * recycling , uh , paper materials , you know , computer output paper and also * to decrease the amount of , uh , Styrofoam usage because of \[ the , \+ uh , the \] process involved in Styrofoam \[ and , \+ and \] the whole eco issue and that . E_S
166074:8	I think 0 \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] what they need *-1 to do *T*-2 . * Be more proactive like that . E_S
166076:18	Uh , \[ I know , \+ uh , I believe \] 0 it was last year that they actually collected the old phone books *T*-1 . E_S

166077:37	* Uh , usually have them come from MUMBLEx you know , projects *-1 to collect old ones . E_S
166099:11	Now I think 0 they 've come up with some way of , uh , * pulling the glue out . E_S
166106:19	uh , what do you think 0 *T*-2 was different *ICH*-1 ten years ago from now ? E_S
166108:56	Well , I would say 0 as , far as social changes go *?* , uh , I think 0 *T*-1 families were more together . E_S
166114:46	Uh , the parents usually took out \[ time , \+ uh , you know , more time \] than they do now *-1 to come with the children and just spend the day *-2 doing a family activity . E_S
166118:50	Uh , although I 'm not a mother , \[ I , \+ I \] still think that , uh , a lot has changed since ten years ago . E_S
166119:19	Uh , what do you think *T*-1 about that ? E_S
166124:30	Well , uh , actually ten years from today seems rather short . E_S
166132:22	And , uh , I do n't know , E_S
166135:10	But I think 0 that has a lot 0 * to do *T*-1 with economic situation . E_S
166139:10	Do you think that the individual has as much time as they did , * let 's say , ten , twenty years ago ? E_S
166145:47	Uh , it *EXP*-2 's hard 0 * to say *T*-1 because I think 0 people were busy ten twenty years ago too . E_S
166161:13	So there 's maybe a five year gap between us . E_S
166167:27	\[ I just , \+ I \] think that things \[ \[ were a bit , \+ were , \] \+ have been \] busy all along . E_S
166180:10	Do you think 0 it 's an economic \[ c- , \+ necessity \] E_S
166181:12	or do you think that \[ we 're , \+ we 're , \] uh , all trying *-1 to keep up with a certain standard of living ? E_S

166183:8	I think 0 that 's part of it too . E_S
166184:13	But I do think , N_S
166186:18	I mean do you think , 0 people really need two cars and a house in the suburbs
166197:13	I do n't think that . E_S
166205:8	I think 0 maybe those people *ICH*-4 that *T*-1 really do need *-2 to work , both parents , *-3 just to survive . N_S
166205:15	I think 0 maybe those people *ICH*-4 that *T*-1 really do need *-2 to work , both parents , *-3 just to survive . N_S
166206:107	And then there , \[ th- , \+ \] \[ is , \+ is \] that other group that *T*-1 is working *-2 to maintain a standard of living that , uh , they think 0 *T*-4 \[ is , \+ is \] surviving which *T*-3 is really more luxuries . E_S
166219:38	Uh , but \[ I \+ I \] tend *-4 to think that it 's less *ICH*-5 those people that *T*-1 have the two cars and everything than it is the group that *T*-2 is just trying *-3 to survive . E_S
166221:25	\[ Yo- , \+ so you \] think 0 it 's , N_S
166228:97	Because if you look at economics across this country and statistics on who *T*-1 has the money and who *T*-2 the decreasing , uh , middle class in this country I think that that 's , in my opinion , the case . E_S
166239:50	And then , sometimes \[ I , \+ I \] often , uh , find that maybe there 's so many different things available to us . \[ Yo- , \+ \] a microwave , a V C R , a answering machine \[ \[ a , \+ you know , a special , \] \+ a \] dishwasher , uh , a refrigerator and some of those items , um , \[ for the , \+ for the , \] uh , N_S

166258:8	I seem *-1 to be younger than most people \[ who , \+ who \] *T*-2 talk on this thing . E_S

166308:14	And they all seem *-2 to go together . E_S

166941:18	But I just do n't think that nursing homes really do a very good job . E_S

166958:10	But I think 0 a lot of nursing homes really , uh , are guilty of neglect . E_S
166961:26	\[ I th- , \+ and I think \] 0 it happens more in areas where it 's , uh , I guess , uh , a broad social medical system where , uh , you know , there 's government medical care and that kind of thing *T*-1 *T*-2 . E_S

166971:33	Actually , * to tell you the truth , I think , uh , 0 jury selection is a , uh , prime , uh , discussion topic in terms of possible improvements on , uh , uh , finding of , uh , guilt . E_S
166973:13	Uh , I certainly ca n't argue with that . E_S
166981:8	I think 0 there 's a limit on that . E_S
166982:60	\[ The , \+ uh , the , \] uh peremptory challenges are limited *-1 to , I do n't know how many , E_S
166984:8	I think 0 it 's , Four or five , E_S
166993:8	it seems to me 0 I 'm always challenged *-2 peremptorily also when I go to these things *T*-1 . E_S
166994:8	I think 0 I have a severe demeanor or something . E_S
167002:30	But , \[ \[ typically , \+ you know , basic- , \] \+ uh , typically , \] uh , everyone gets involved *-1 in , uh , the jury process E_S
167003:22	and I suppose 0 an elitist might say , well , you really want someone who *T*-1 is well educated *-2 to be able *-3 \[ to , \+ to \] winnow the facts \[ from the , \+ from the \] prejudice . E_S
167030:17	So , uh , I think 0 the jury selection process is pretty neat , E_S
167031:15	but I do n't think that the jury ought *-1 to be the ones picking the punishment afterwards . E_S
167035:8	I think 0 that should be left *-2 up to people who *T*-1 have some knowledge in the subject and more knowledge than a jury would have *?* . E_S

167043:10	but I think that it *EXP*-2 should be up to the judge and the , uh , lawyers * to make the decision as to what the actual penalty will be *T*-1 . E_S
167047:40	Maybe just the judge because they 're the people who *T*-1 know what the system is *T*-2 and what it 's all about *T*-3 and believe in the system . E_S
167047:84	Maybe just the judge because they 're the people who *T*-1 know what the system is *T*-2 and what it 's all about *T*-3 and believe in the system . E_S
167057:15	Uh , and I think 0 that would provide a more fair sentencing procedure . As opposed to an emotional sentencing procedure . Also , may be a more consistent sentencing procedure . E_S
167057:72	Uh , and I think 0 that would provide a more fair sentencing procedure . As opposed to an emotional sentencing procedure . Also , may be a more consistent sentencing procedure . E_S
167059:23	Well , I suppose 0 you may be right on that . E_S
167080:68	But when it comes to what kind of sentence you 're going *-1 to lay *T*-2 down *T*-3 , I think \[ that , \+ uh , that \] they should *?* . E_S
167084:34	\[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] know that they always have *?* because I never sat all the way through a jury trial . E_S
167090:37	Well , if it 's a second offense , the punishment should certainly be more severe than a first offense , because obviously , the rehabilitation process did not work the first time . E_S
167100:8	I think 0 those ought *-1 to be punished *-1 a whole lot worse than they are *?* . E_S
167116:14	What do you think *T*-1 ? E_S
167119:23	Well , actually , I do n't think 0 they 're out of line . E_S
167128:48	Really , \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] do n't think 0 that 's a valid argument . E_S
167129:8	I think that most people are quite aware 0 they 're not paying that six percent sales tax . E_S
167135:23	Well , I mean , it seems to me that , generally , at least in my own experience , when I purchase something mail order *T*-2 , it 's not * to circumvent *-1 paying sales tax to the State of Pennsylvania . E_S
167142:10	And I think that it *EXP*-3 's not my responsibility * to police myself and pay Pennsylvania what they believe 0 they are owed *-1 *T*-2 even though , you know , the revenue stream went to another state . E_S

167186:140	\[ if , \+ if \] I 'm a computer consulting firm and I see \[ these , \+ this \] great deal on forty-six mother boards , uh , \[ from , \+ from \] say Utah . E_S Um , \[ I , \+ I \] might buy the mother boards from Utah but then still have *-1 to pay Pennsylvania sales tax . E_S

167197:67	Uh , but , if that 's the case , if the business is responsible for *-3 policing themselves , then I think 0 some well defined mechanisms need *-1 to be in place so that , uh , the opportunity \[ f- , \+ \] * to forget that you owe sales tax for something , uh , can be avoided *-2 . E_S

E_S
167203:43	Uh , I mean , \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know if I agree with that . E_S

167219:13	I do n't think 0 it should just be used *-1 loosely . E_S

168042:76	well they 've already passed laws where you have *-1 to get your cars checked *-3 for pollution if you 're in certain counties *T*-2 , E_S

168558:29	\[ but , \+ but \] I do n't know . E_S
168559:8	I think 0 I would rather *ICH*-2 0 a person go ahead and be put *-1 down than * give them the opportunity * to get out and do it again . E_S
168564:89	but I still feel very strongly that capital punishment is a good way 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] punish *T*-1 , especially criminals who *T*-2 seem *-3 to have absolutely no remorse for what they 've done *T*-4 . E_S
168573:10	you know , that 's fourteen years old . E_S
168577:8	I certainly do n't , uh , advocate * turning people like that loose . E_S
168581:13	I 'm not sure 0 * executing them , uh , does anymore than * keeping them in jail , E_S
168621:28	but \[ it 's , \+ but I think 0 it 's \] relatively unimportant compared to what 's the most effective way of , * dealing with crime *T*-1 E_S
168625:13	I do n't know , E_S
168626:12	the European countries certainly , uh , none of them have capital punishment E_S
168634:15	and I do n't believe 0 they do in Germany or Italy either E_S
168636:16	I do n't really think that there is too much of a relationship between the two . E_S
168640:106	I guess 0 what *T*-1 worries me about capital punishment is , uh , 0 when I see people enthusiastic about it and , uh , uh , sort of bloodthirsty *T*-2 . I think 0 it brings out the worst \[ in the , \+ in the \] people who *T*-3 do the punishing E_S
168643:8	You might be right . E_S
168648:79	I mean \[ I , \+ I 'd \] hate *-1 to be the person 0 *T*-2 to pull the switch , you know , E_S
168655:13	but I do believe 0 it 's necessary E_S
168668:71	the other thing that *T*-1 bothers me is when it becomes a political issue *T*-2 because \[ I do n't really think 0 it , \+ uh , I do n't really think 0 it 's \] a very important aspect of * fighting crime or law and order or anything else . E_S

168669:8	I think 0 it just becomes a , uh , symbolic I 'm tougher than you are *?* type of emotional issue for politicians E_S
168678:30	Like I said , some years ago , I think 0 I would have said 0 there 's no place for capital punishment in the , civilized western country . E_S
168684:37	Now \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] not so sure of that . E_S
168687:49	\[ What \+ what 's *T*-1 \] making you become more convinced that it might be a good way of * punishing ? E_S

168710:17	I , N_S you know ,

168726:8	It seems bizarre to me . E_S
168727:31	I do n't quite understand it , although I think probably 0 \[ the , \+ the \] worst thing that *T*-1 's happening \[ in the world , \+ at least the modern world \] today , is television . E_S

168759:8	Television sure makes child rearing easy on you . E_S

168770:13	I do n't think so either . E_S
168772:19	Uh , so , you know , I do n't know , E_S
168772:32	Uh , so , you know , I do n't know , E_S
168777:14	and , you know , whenever you 're with your kids *T*-2 , you want *-1 to interact with them rather than just ignore them . E_S
168815:15	Oh , you know , reading is so good . E_S
168818:34	\[ I , \+ uh , I \] took great pleasure in * reading to my kids when they were little *T*-1 E_S

168889:14	that 's for sure . E_S

168896:14	What do you think *T*-1 ? E_S
168898:18	Oh , I do n't know . E_S

168931:38	\[ I , \+ I \] had n't *?* , you know , E_S
168933:97	But there were some things *ICH*-3 that people brought *T*-1 up like well what *T*-2 happens if \[ they , \+ they \] get a false positive , you know , what recourse do you have *T*-4 . E_S

168972:125	Wel- , I guess 0 it kind of borders on \[ where , \+ I mean what \] do you value *T*-1 more . The invasion of , uh , the person 's privacy or the possible danger to , you know , other people . E_S
168993:31	, I mean they could require , you know , \[ ob- , \+ obligatory \] AIDS testing for everyone because \[ I 'm , \+ \] you know , there 's a huge part of the population , E_S

169029:28	\[ I , \+ uh , I \] think 0 the question is posed *-1 somewhat strangely because , uh , it 's talking about a requirement for public service E_S

169102:33	\[ so . \+ But , \] uh , you know , for some people that 's good . E_S
169103:62	\[ I , \+ I \] do n't particular like the fact that it 's the military , you know , E_S

169134:13	Uh , I know that there 's been some increases in crime lately in terms of murders . E_S
169144:19	But , actually , you know , when you look \[ at , \+ at \] Minneapolis as compared to where I used *-1 to live *T*-2 *T*-3 , it 's really quite a bit better . Uh , because I came from Florida E_S
169160:15	Here , you know , the real problems are the gangs . E_S
169180:8	You know . E_S
169187:79	We have a neighborhood watch program in \[ the house , \+ uh , the development \] that we live in *T*-2 , which I think 0 *T*-1 is a great way 0 * to reduce , uh , home theft , burglary , and things of that sort *T*-3 . E_S
169210:83	it 's one of those things where the new thing is that they operate in the daylight because everybody went to work *T*-1 , you know , E_S
169216:8	I think 0 given that people are pretty conscientious about it , N_S that 's a good way 0 * \[ to , \+ to \] work it *T*-1 , with a neighborhood watch . E_S
169221:15	Well , you know , uh , also I 've heard that , uh , the newest thing is 0 a lot of people are specializing in *-1 robbing people during the time 0 they 're home *T*-2 . Like on the weekends . E_S
169226:8	I think 0 it 's like fifty percent of most people 's free time is , uh , spent *T*-1 * doing yard work outdoors . E_S

169247:11	it almost seems like they 're getting quite a bit smarter . E_S
169251:14	Really , you know . E_S

169277:8	I think 0 we 've got a neighborhood watch program here in Minneapolis , E_S

169285:11	Like I know a lot of my neighbors right around my development .
169299:13	I 'm not sure where we went *T*-1 from there , E_S
169310:4	sure . E_S
169317:42	You can have the house alarm , uh neighborhood watch program , you know , uh , as a woman not go out at night E_S

169418:10	You know , someone will write a book about something E_S

Uh , without *-6 thinking that there were people \[ in , \+ \] who *T*-5 think 0 each other \[ areas , \+ area \] \[ of , \+ of \] specialty N_S
169441:147	And the view that I would rather take *T*-1 is that there 's a different amount of information 0 you need *T*-2 when you 're particularly interested in a topic or , uh , particularly interested in *-7 buying something \[ as a , \+ you know as a \] hobbyist *T*-5 versus when you want *-3 to go out and buy a blender because you need *-4 to mix things *T*-6 . E_S
169451:10	And I think 0 the same thing is true with news . E_S
169459:74	If you were deeply involved in it , then you immediately realize that what they print *T*-1 is stuff that you probably knew *T*-5 already and the stuff that you want *T*-2 they 're not printing *T*-4 because the average person does n't need or want *-3 to know that much . E_S

169480:13	I do n't think 0 it 's that high . E_S

169488:10	And I think 0 they 're saying well if something 's really important , I 'll at least find out that it happened . E_S
169521:10	And I thought 0 that was terrific because she actually helped me understand what *T*-1 was going on . E_S
169548:5	probably the best things 0 * to do *T*-1 \[ is , \+ is \] * tie them with a rope and throw them in the water E_S
169565:18	Uh , I do n't know . E_S

169577:13	Uh , it seems to me that the judge does it E_S
169578:25	and \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 that 's probably all right in that they , you know , maybe know what \[ the , \+ the \] norm *ICH*-2 is *T*-1 for a particular thing . E_S

169588:30	Possibly though on , uh , capital cases like maybe the death penalty N_S
169594:10	You know , judges are people like everybody else even though \[ they 're , \+ they 're \] supposed *-1 to be impartial E_S
169598:7	but maybe , uh , N_S
169600:10	And I think 0 \[ \[ that may , \+ I , \] \+ that may \] be an exception as well . E_S

169624:24	the , uh , Governor , you know , has been trying *-1 to decide whether he 's going *-2 to commute it or not . E_S
169628:10	You know , it 's someone who *T*-1 had , uh , killed two teenage boys here in San Diego as a matter of fact . E_S
169639:29	I guess 0 the way 0 I think about it *T*-1 \[ is not , \+ \] it should n't necessarily be thought of *-2 as revenge . E_S
169639:72	I guess 0 the way 0 I think about it *T*-1 \[ is not , \+ \] it should n't necessarily be thought of *-2 as revenge . E_S
169644:27	* put it to sleep , you know . E_S
169645:27	* Just get it out , you know , E_S
169646:36	it 's not able *-1 to fit in , you know . E_S
169653:41	Uh , I guess , kind of 0 the way 0 I think about it *T*-1 also , is 0 they just , N_S
169659:20	and if not , you know , * \[ do n't , \+ do n't \] let them sit up there on death row for , you know , fifteen years . E_S
169659:84	and if not , you know , * \[ do n't , \+ do n't \] let them sit up there on death row for , you know , fifteen years . E_S
169662:8	I think 0 this particular case has been like ten or fifteen years . E_S
169668:55	But I guess 0 there have been several cases where people have been executed *-1 by mistake *T*-2 E_S
169672:16	Oh , I 'm sure . E_S
169677:92	The other thing 0 they asked about *T*-1 was whether uh , uh , the verdict should be required *-2 to be unanimous . Which , again , I think 0 *T*-3 is the way 0 it is *T*-5 now . That \[ all the , \+ all \] verdicts , N_S
169681:8	well maybe not . E_S
169682:13	I do n't know . E_S
169683:24	At least in capital cases I 'd think 0 they 'd have *-1 to be unanimous . E_S
169685:8	I believe 0 it is *?* in capital . E_S
169688:8	I think 0 in like , uh , lesser cases it 's like ten out of twelve or five out of six , whatever . How ever many *T*-1 is \[ on , \+ sitting on \] a jury . E_S
169692:24	\[ I t- , \+ I believe \] 0 that 's the way 0 it is *T*-1 . E_S
169693:15	But I 'm pretty sure 0 you 're correct on capital cases .
169716:26	\[ That , \+ that 's \] probably an expensive trial .
169729:10	You know , I 'm not sure 0 there 's a number . E_S
169729:23	You know , I 'm not sure 0 there 's a number . E_S
169730:11	It 's probably like thirty , forty thousand dollars a day you know , worth of all the free for all . E_S
169730:42	It 's probably like thirty , forty thousand dollars a day you know , worth of all the free for all . E_S
169736:91	\[ that 's , \+ that 's \] been so long 0 I 've \[ prac- , \+ practically \] forgot who Noriega was *T*-1 , you know . E_S
169787:20	I mean , you know , this is the rules that they can do this anytime . E_S
169788:18	Uh , I do n't know of anyone who *T*-1 ever has been picked *-2 out and been tested *-2 . E_S
169805:16	So what do you think *T*-1 about that ? E_S
169807:39	Uh , \[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] think 0 they 're very accurate E_S
169808:23	because , I mean , I know 0 their lifestyles changed \[ p- , \+ prior \] to the drug test E_S
169809:10	and I know 0 they changed afterwards . E_S
169813:11	See I know of that too . E_S
169814:13	And I also know that things like antihistamines , Sudafeds , things like that , can really throw it off . E_S
169816:10	and they may not tell you the reason why .
169830:11	because I know of somebody that *T*-1 tested for an airline and did n't get the job E_S
169837:8	I thought 0 \[ they got , \+ you got \] called back if you tested positive , for more tests . E_S
169842:13	I do n't know . E_S
169844:23	\[ How , \+ do you know how \] wrong they are *T*-1 ? E_S
169844:32	\[ How , \+ do you know how \] wrong they are *T*-1 ? E_S
169848:13	I do n't know . E_S
169849:13	I do n't know . E_S
169850:12	But , I know 0 there are a lot of things that *T*-1 can influence them E_S
169851:10	and I think that a person deserves a second chance with it or something because most things will stay in your system for a long time . E_S
169862:89	And he said this way if it were *-1 to make the drug test positive , you have proof that your doctor ordered this for you , you know . E_S
169865:68	and if they would just say oh , this person 's drug test is positive we wo n't hire them you know . Then you could lose out on a job when really you did n't do anything *T*-1 . E_S
169872:15	So I do n't know . E_S
169874:32	And \[ I , \+ I 'm \] not so sure 0 they are that needed . E_S
169877:13	I 'm not sure either . E_S
169893:15	I 'm not real sure how I feel *T*-1 about it because I can see it from two ways . E_S
169894:10	You know , as a health professional , I would n't want somebody *ICH*-1 to take care of me that *T*-2 was using drugs . E_S
169898:10	You know , so as a patient , I feel 0 well , yeah , we probably should be protected *-1 . E_S
169898:50	You know , so as a patient , I feel 0 well , yeah , we probably should be protected *-1 . E_S
169900:12	So you know , I guess 0 \[ you sort of , \+ you \] have *-1 to have trust some place along the way . E_S
169908:17	So , I do n't know . E_S
169909:25	And \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 it could be used *-1 *-2 to hassle somebody . E_S
169910:36	If someone was out *-1 to get you , I think that a company or a boss could use this . E_S
169911:11	You know , they could keep on *-1 doing this to you or something , I guess 0 *T*-2 . E_S
169914:44	And \[ \[ it , \+ it 's \] like , \+ it seems like \] now they have tests E_S
169922:7	But maybe you should n't be held *-1 responsible for something 0 you did *T*-2 several years ago . E_S
169927:8	I know . E_S
169930:62	I mean \[ a lot of , \+ a lot of \] people as kids or , you know , young people get into some things that they get out of *T*-1 later on E_S
169931:15	and I do n't think 0 they should really have *-1 to pay for that forever . E_S
169938:28	but you ca n't say 0 it was wrong at the time . E_S
169940:8	I think 0 that 's true . E_S
169945:10	So that probably would n't be too good either . E_S
169952:10	You know , \[ \[ what , \+ what , \] \+ uh , what \] do you think 0 *T*-1 is important ? E_S
169952:59	You know , \[ \[ what , \+ what , \] \+ uh , what \] do you think 0 *T*-1 is important ? E_S
169954:18	uh , I do n't know \[ how , \+ how \] old you are *T*-1 , E_S
169955:161	but \[ if you had , \+ if you had , \] uh , parents say \[ \[ or , \+ or , \] \+ or \] \[ th- , \+ \] grandparents , whatever it is *T*-1 , uh , who *T*-2 were ready , \[ who , \+ who \] you thought 0 *T*-3 might benefit from a nursing home , what do you think 0 you would look for *T*-4 ? E_S
169955:171	but \[ if you had , \+ if you had , \] uh , parents say \[ \[ or , \+ or , \] \+ or \] \[ th- , \+ \] grandparents , whatever it is *T*-1 , uh , who *T*-2 were ready , \[ who , \+ who \] you thought 0 *T*-3 might benefit from a nursing home , what do you think 0 you would look for *T*-4 ?

E_S
169969:8	I think 0 I 'd look for a home where they got a lot of attention *T*-1 and , uh , where they did some things *-2 to try *-3 to keep them , um , mentally alive *T*-4 . And \[ where there was , uh , caring and compassionate , \+ where there were caring and compassionate \] people , uh , operating it *T*-5 . E_S
169989:10	And it seems , uh , N_S
169990:47	I mean \[ the , \+ the \] environment there , I do n't know too much about it E_S
169991:25	but \[ it , \+ it \] seems nice enough . E_S
169994:129	So it *EXP*-2 's hard * to tell how much of that *T*-3 rubs off on those who *T*-1 are struggling *-4 \[ to r- , \+ to retain , \] uh , clarity , say , uh , you know . E_S
169999:50	Well \[ \[ I , \+ I \] don- , \+ I do n't \] know . E_S
170007:181	but again , um , it must be depressing for the people \[ \[ who , \+ who \] *T*-1 are , \+ who *T*-2 are \] just \[ \[ e- , \+ e- , \] \+ essentially \] not able *-3 to take care of themselves in their own house \[ but , \+ but , \] \[ certainly , \+ uh , certainly \] \[ \[ \[ \[ have \+ ar- , \] \+ ar- , \] \+ are , \] \+ have \] retained all of their , uh , mental skills and so on . E_S
170007:194	but again , um , it must be depressing for the people \[ \[ who , \+ who \] *T*-1 are , \+ who *T*-2 are \] just \[ \[ e- , \+ e- , \] \+ essentially \] not able *-3 to take care of themselves in their own house \[ but , \+ but , \] \[ certainly , \+ uh , certainly \] \[ \[ \[ \[ have \+ ar- , \] \+ ar- , \] \+ are , \] \+ have \] retained all of their , uh , mental skills and so on .

170008:134	It *ICH*-2 's , must be depressing * \[ to , \+ to \] \[ walk , \+ walk \] the halls \[ and see , \+ \[ an- , \+ and \] see \] all these other people who *T*-3 really do n't know where they are *T*-1 . E_S
170010:10	Do you think that in the case of the one that you 've actually had some experience with *T*-1 , that the people who *T*-2 operate it seem *-3 to have , what you 'd perceive of *T*-4 as genuine concern ? E_S
170010:88	Do you think that in the case of the one that you 've actually had some experience with *T*-1 , that the people who *T*-2 operate it seem *-3 to have , what you 'd perceive of *T*-4 as genuine concern ? E_S
170012:8	I think , yeah , E_S
170013:8	I think 0 they 're relatively \[ re- , \+ respectful . \] Yeah \[ and , \+ and \] concerned \[ that , \+ \] in as much as they can be *?* . E_S
170014:28	\[ \[ I , \+ I \] think sometimes , \+ you know , I 've noticed , \] uh , \[ people asking for , \+ uh , some of the patients asking for \] things *ICH*-1 , uh , just repetitively \[ and , \+ but \] things that *T*-2 are not reasonable , E_S
170014:44	\[ \[ I , \+ I \] think sometimes , \+ you know , I 've noticed , \] uh , \[ people asking for , \+ uh , some of the patients asking for \] things *ICH*-1 , uh , just repetitively \[ and , \+ but \] things that *T*-2 are not reasonable , E_S

170023:26	and so it looks to me like maybe their not catering to this person 's needs is really because this person \[ is just , \+ you know , is just \] in a state where they do n't really need what they think 0 they need *T*-1 *T*-2 , you know . E_S
170023:86	and so it looks to me like maybe their not catering to this person 's needs is really because this person \[ is just , \+ you know , is just \] in a state where they do n't really need what they think 0 they need *T*-1 *T*-2 , you know . E_S

170027:11	I was thinking also that \[ there 'd be , \+ there could be \] a fair burn out factor um , in * just having *-2 to respond to people 's needs where the needs are sometimes , depending on the person , not going *-3 to be what we would perceive of *T*-1 as rational need *T*-4 . E_S
170051:33	and it did n't look like , uh , you know , how , \[ \[ yo- , \+ you , \] \+ you \] walk into some rooms *T*-1 E_S and \[ there 's , \+ it 's \] completely generic . E_S
170052:17	There 's nothing , maybe a picture or two that *T*-1 belongs to that person E_S
170054:31	But this room , on the other hand , you know , they got rid *-1 of all of the sort of standard issue beds and dressers and this and that E_S
170058:103	and it must also give them a sense of , uh , uh , security \[ \[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ uh , and , \] \+ and , \] you know , \[ s- , \+ s- , \] uh , N_S
170061:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 part of what you 're saying *T*-1 matches what I \[ h- , \+ have \] read *T*-2 . E_S
170062:21	I used *-1 to initially think that the only people who *T*-2 went into such residences were people who , uh , *T*-3 were adequately deficient in their abilities , uh physical or mental , that they could n't take care of themselves . E_S
170066:13	But I also know a couple of people whose parents *T*-1 have gone into such things because I think they provide , um , a lot of social activities . E_S

170081:16	Well \[ I think 0 it , \+ I think 0 \[ t- , \+ it \] \] was sort of on the grounds that they were considering whether she would live there E_S
170081:34	Well \[ I think 0 it , \+ I think 0 \[ t- , \+ it \] \] was sort of on the grounds that they were considering whether she would live there E_S
170082:48	and I feel like , the whole vocabulary of this is very loaded if you think of words \[ like , \+ like \] * put her in there . E_S
170102:15	and I do n't know , E_S
170114:12	Uh , so maybe we should start with you . E_S
170185:58	and \[ \[ \[ it , \+ that \] \+ I , \] \+ I \] do n't know if I ever went as far as three months *ICH*-1 or not \[ \[ i- , \+ i- , \] \+ in \] *-2 keeping that kind of data . E_S
170186:8	I certainly have n't done that in sixteen years or whatever . E_S
170205:35	And I figure 0 that gives me room for the mistakes 0 I make *T*-1 . E_S
170214:39	someday , if I were *-1 to get remarried *-2 I might want *-3 to buy a house which *T*-4 requires lots of money which I do n't have *T*-5 E_S
170215:40	and \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] think 0 my strategy \[ if , \+ if \] I may , \[ \[ \[ i- , \+ i- , \] \+ is * to , \] \+ is * to \] not spend money . E_S
170215:74	and \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] think 0 my strategy \[ if , \+ if \] I may , \[ \[ \[ i- , \+ i- , \] \+ is * to , \] \+ is * to \] not spend money . E_S
170242:65	but for me , I only do that every week or , \[ without even , \+ \] I mean , maybe once a month . E_S
170260:35	\[ So , \+ so \] that 's , I think 0 *T*-4 , one of the reasons 0 I do n't need *-1 to budget *T*-2 is that \[ \[ I do n't have , \+ I do n't , \] \+ I do n't have \] *-3 to hold myself back from *-5 buying that expensive thing because I ca n't afford it , because I 'm not interested in that expensive thing . E_S
170280:55	The area 0 I work in *T*-1 , \[ it , \+ it \] primarily have maybe a hundred people or so . E_S
170292:48	Well , \[ I , \+ I \] work for , uh , *ICH*-1 actually probably similar kind of place . E_S
170312:95	Uh , while I was sitting here *-1 waiting while they tried *-2 to find somebody 0 for me to talk to *T*-3 , *-1 trying *-8 to think of \[ what , \+ uh , uh , what \] things *ICH*-5 *T*-4 were important , uh , besides salary \[ and a , \+ and a \] job .

E_S
170312:257	Uh , while I was sitting here *-1 waiting while they tried *-2 to find somebody 0 for me to talk to *T*-3 , *-1 trying *-8 to think of \[ what , \+ uh , uh , what \] things *ICH*-5 *T*-4 were important , uh , besides salary \[ and a , \+ and a \] job .

E_S
170319:13	I do n't know . E_S
170322:15	Well those and probably the security aspect of it . E_S
170327:10	and it may not be true in every place . E_S
170328:23	In a lot of cases I think 0 you 're treated *-1 more like a number instead of \[ a , \+ a \] person *T*-2 . E_S
170332:74	Because when it come down to layoff *T*-1 , they do n't really consider people \[ and , \+ and , \] you know , their well being as far as , you know , how \[ they going , \+ their next dollar going \] *-3 to come in *T*-2 . E_S How they going *-4 to pay their bills *T*-5 . E_S
170332:102	Because when it come down to layoff *T*-1 , they do n't really consider people \[ and , \+ and , \] you know , their well being as far as , you know , how \[ they going , \+ their next dollar going \] *-3 to come in *T*-2 . E_S How they going *-4 to pay their bills *T*-5 . E_S
170338:8	I think 0 the company still exists . E_S
170339:100	What they use *-1 to do *T*-2 is , they used *-3 to cut the number of hours for everybody as opposed to *-4 just laying people off you know . E_S
170343:20	That way that , you know , one person would n't get one big blunt blow at one time . E_S
170347:19	And , uh , you know , I think 0 if they had programs that *T*-1 set up *-2 to subsidize people that *T*-3 do get laid *-4 off a little bit better , you know , other than \[ s- , \+ you know , something \] like , N_S
170347:27	And , uh , you know , I think 0 if they had programs that *T*-1 set up *-2 to subsidize people that *T*-3 do get laid *-4 off a little bit better , you know , other than \[ s- , \+ you know , something \] like , N_S
170347:117	And , uh , you know , I think 0 if they had programs that *T*-1 set up *-2 to subsidize people that *T*-3 do get laid *-4 off a little bit better , you know , other than \[ s- , \+ you know , something \] like , N_S
170347:145	And , uh , you know , I think 0 if they had programs that *T*-1 set up *-2 to subsidize people that *T*-3 do get laid *-4 off a little bit better , you know , other than \[ s- , \+ you know , something \] like , N_S
170355:93	So there should be something *ICH*-2 in there or some kind of clause that *T*-1 will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than , you know , uh , neglect or something like that . E_S
170359:10	You know . Because it *EXP*-1 's not a person 's fault that , you know , people not buying or businesses \[ are , \+ are \] not on the up and up all the time , you know . E_S
170359:50	You know . Because it *EXP*-1 's not a person 's fault that , you know , people not buying or businesses \[ are , \+ are \] not on the up and up all the time , you know . E_S
170359:117	You know . Because it *EXP*-1 's not a person 's fault that , you know , people not buying or businesses \[ are , \+ are \] not on the up and up all the time , you know . E_S
170360:35	I do n't see how one or two people , maybe more one or two , but , you know , a number of people \[ can , \+ can \] be the downfall of \[ com- , \+ a company \] situation *T*-1 . E_S
170360:57	I do n't see how one or two people , maybe more one or two , but , you know , a number of people \[ can , \+ can \] be the downfall of \[ com- , \+ a company \] situation *T*-1 . E_S
170363:8	I know it , N_S
170373:10	You know . In that standpoint . E_S
170375:28	Well , \[ you , \+ you \] think 0 it *EXP*-2 's better than * \[ to , \+ to \] try *-1 to spread \[ the , \+ the \] effort equally among all the employees of the company E_S
170384:8	I think 0 it 'd be better that way E_S
170385:73	and even at that , it would at least give the person time 0 * to look for another job *T*-1 because they know \[ that \+ MUMBLEx that \] there are problems E_S
170389:14	and , you know , there are reason 0 * to look for another job instead of * just dumping it on them all at one time *T*-1 . E_S
170396:10	You know . \[ That 's just , \+ that 's \] my views , you know . E_S
170396:55	You know . \[ That 's just , \+ that 's \] my views , you know . E_S
170400:8	I think , uh , 0 back about , a few years ago when things were tough *T*-1 , Hewlett-Packard did that for awhile . E_S
170411:10	And I think 0 you can do that for a little while E_S
170414:47	Well at least that would give a person a chance * to look you know . Because the way 0 it is *T*-1 , a person really do n't have a chance . E_S
170443:8	I think 0 you 're doing a good job . E_S
170450:22	And , uh , I do n't think , uh , N_S
170452:66	\[ My , \+ my \] wife and I are , \[ u- , \+ \] in our forties , you know , E_S
170457:42	but it *EXP*-1 's hard * to raise one child without them thinking 0 \[ they 're the , \+ they 're the \] pivot point of the universe . E_S
170459:8	I think 0 you are right E_S
170484:35	That 's exactly how it is *T*-1 , you know . E_S
170486:55	When things do n't go right *T*-1 , she just calls one of them , you know . E_S
170492:8	I think 0 it was easier when they all had each other and could entertain each other and I was home more *T*-1 . E_S
170517:7	and maybe dancing school for a while or mainly school sports and things like that . E_S
170519:10	You know , I think 0 that 's probably true .
170519:18	You know , I think 0 that 's probably true .
170519:31	You know , I think 0 that 's probably true .
170540:37	if there were more than one child , I do n't know , \[ the- , \+ there \] would be no way 0 * to do it *T*-1 . E_S
170545:10	You know , one parent go one direction E_S
170553:11	Well I know 0 I spent hours in the gym every day with my daughter E_S
170575:13	I do n't think , although \[ i- , \+ i- , \] N_S
170576:8	I think 0 \[ \[ a , \+ a , \] \+ \] more than one child , probably three children is probably the ideal to me E_S
170576:60	I think 0 \[ \[ a , \+ a , \] \+ \] more than one child , probably three children is probably the ideal to me E_S
170576:71	I think 0 \[ \[ a , \+ a , \] \+ \] more than one child , probably three children is probably the ideal to me E_S
170577:15	but I 'm not sure 0 I could afford three . E_S
170578:10	I most certainly could n't educate three . E_S
170581:13	I do n't know how \[ my , \+ my \] parents did it *T*-1 . E_S
170586:25	and I do n't recall , you know , *-1 wanting anything in particular . E_S
170587:20	Uh , but I do n't know how my father did it *T*-1 . E_S
170593:36	and \[ we do n't , \+ I do n't \] believe 0 we have as much as my parents did E_S
170601:13	I do n't know how it is *T*-1 in Georgia E_S
170605:15	and I do n't think 0 our part of the country is particularly bad compared to some . E_S
170618:17	and they , you know , N_S
170629:23	\[ they , \+ they \] think 0 \[ they , \+ they \] have really done something . E_S
170647:23	\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 perhaps the automotive industry is improving E_S
170653:17	and , uh , it seemed that the only way 0 I could reliably take care of my car *T*-2 was * to repair it myself which *T*-1 is not my cup of tea . E_S
170684:50	Every time 0 I get taken *-4 to an auto repair place *T*-3 , you know , every time 0 I go *T*-1 , I get taken *-2 . E_S
170685:13	Bad you know . E_S
170691:71	* Let 's \[ ge- , \+ \] see how much money we can get *T*-1 out of her , you know . E_S
170720:13	and everything is wrong with it . E_S
170723:22	the brake fluid leaks , you know , E_S
170736:33	So he is trying *-1 to get , you know , things fixed *-2 on it . E_S
170740:23	But it 's just , you know , * leak , leak , leak everywhere . E_S
170741:19	But , uh , you know , I hate *-1 to go into \[ a , \+ a \] repair place because they 'll tell me 0 something is wrong with it and it 's not *?* , you know , and *-2 charge me twice as much . E_S
170741:92	But , uh , you know , I hate *-1 to go into \[ a , \+ a \] repair place because they 'll tell me 0 something is wrong with it and it 's not *?* , you know , and *-2 charge me twice as much . E_S
170741:122	But , uh , you know , I hate *-1 to go into \[ a , \+ a \] repair place because they 'll tell me 0 something is wrong with it and it 's not *?* , you know , and *-2 charge me twice as much . E_S
170746:25	and he asked me , N_S you know ,
170754:18	and I did n't even know what one was *T*-1 . E_S
170763:53	* \[ Apparently just , uh , \[ re- , \+ re- , \] \+ uh , probably filled \] \[ the , \+ the \] brake fluid up E_S
170766:16	That was it , probably . E_S
170774:58	\[ And , \+ and \] you \[ ju- , \+ \] can hardly find one , you know . E_S
170779:28	and that 's the only reason , you know , 0 I go to him *T*-1 because I know him E_S
170779:60	and that 's the only reason , you know , 0 I go to him *T*-1 because I know him E_S
170783:10	and I know 0 he will tell me the truth . E_S
170785:32	so he 's not going *-1 to , you know , take me . E_S
170801:17	so , I do n't know . E_S
170802:13	I do n't know what the solution to that is *T*-1
170811:22	\[ we , \+ you know , they told us 0 we \] just had *-1 to have one E_S
170814:24	* give me break , you know . E_S
170821:10	Do you know anyone that , uh , *T*-1 \[ is , \+ is \] in a nursing home or has ever been in one ? E_S
170825:10	so I know what they 've said *T*-1 . E_S
170831:26	Well , I 'm trying *-1 to think . E_S
170835:85	and the nursing home made them come and take her back because she was being \[ \[ \[ a , \+ a , \] \+ you know , a , \] \+ a \] nuisance . Or worse than a nuisance , E_S
170836:31	I mean she sort of went , you know , bananas E_S
170838:11	Oh they thought 0 it was too much of a bother . E_S
170841:39	So , I guess 0 you need *-1 to , uh , know whether it 's \[ a , \+ you know , a \] no deposit , no return kind of thing whether , N_S
170841:70	So , I guess 0 you need *-1 to , uh , know whether it 's \[ a , \+ you know , a \] no deposit , no return kind of thing whether , N_S
170844:92	If they 're equipped *-1 *-1 \[ too , \+ to \] handle the kind of patients 0 you 're going *-3 to have *T*-2 you know , put *-4 in there too . E_S
170848:11	Because I know 0 my grandparents wanted *-1 to have some independence still . E_S
170861:49	so for , uh , the first few years she had her own apartment and , you know , made her own meals sometimes . But \[ could , \+ could \] also go and eat someplace else . E_S
170869:13	I do n't know whether that 's because they , you know , sort of give up hope once they get in there or what \[ the , \+ the \] reason is *T*-1 . E_S
170869:41	I do n't know whether that 's because they , you know , sort of give up hope once they get in there or what \[ the , \+ the \] reason is *T*-1 . E_S
170870:10	But I think 0 the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home *T*-1 is only like six months or something . E_S
170872:23	Well a lot of it 's probably *-1 to do with the fact that people go to it because they need help . E_S
170881:11	That 's probably a large factor . E_S
170894:54	it was just so that the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind *-1 knowing that if anything happened , there was somebody there for them . E_S
170898:15	So that was their thinking . E_S
170899:19	Somebody who *T*-1 would know what * to do *T*-2 in the event of an emergency . E_S
170938:15	And \[ you probably , \+ if it were you , you probably \] would n't want someone choosing a place 0 for you to live *T*-1 based on lowest price . E_S
170938:41	And \[ you probably , \+ if it were you , you probably \] would n't want someone choosing a place 0 for you to live *T*-1 based on lowest price . E_S
170942:47	So , \[ it , \+ it 's \] just so complicated anymore , I think 0 *T*-2 . E_S
170948:8	Well maybe that 's the purpose of the nursing home is * to have them go someplace where they can see that it 's not worth * continuing *T*-1 . E_S
170951:8	I think 0 the retirement home idea 's a nice idea .
170962:11	I 've known quite a few people that *T*-1 have , uh , gone to retirement communities . E_S
170963:13	I do n't know if they have them back there E_S
170974:48	I guess , uh , 0 the only rule , uh , 0 I can think of *T*-1 is that I like *-2 to look for places with , uh , good respectable , nonprofit behind them like a university or a hospital or something like that . E_S
170979:13	Uh , I think 0 it 's sort of the opposite of what you would want *T*-2 when you buy a car or refrigerator something *T*-1 . E_S
171007:85	I suppose , uh , 0 \[ if you 're , \+ if there \] is a psychology department or an education department around , \[ you might find \+ you might find \] that they 're pushing one form of education or another , E_S
171007:97	I suppose , uh , 0 \[ if you 're , \+ if there \] is a psychology department or an education department around , \[ you might find \+ you might find \] that they 're pushing one form of education or another , E_S
171011:17	and they , you know , N_S pretty good people . N_S
171022:18	I tend *-1 to think 0 those are very rare but quickly exploited *-2 and made *-2 public E_S
171030:27	Uh , \[ I , \+ you know , I \] think 0 those things get into the headlines immediately when somebody finds out about them *T*-1 E_S
171030:38	Uh , \[ I , \+ you know , I \] think 0 those things get into the headlines immediately when somebody finds out about them *T*-1 E_S
171035:13	I do n't think 0 it 's as common as , uh , the newspapers would make you believe . E_S
171035:58	I do n't think 0 it 's as common as , uh , the newspapers would make you believe . E_S
171043:8	I know so many of my friends 0 I went to school with *T*-1 who *T*-2 are having babies right now E_S
171052:10	And I think 0 it was the right thing 0 * to do *T*-1 E_S
171064:8	I think 0 my wife is much better *ICH*-1 than I am *?* at that walking into a place and getting a feeling for whether it is a loving and caring place or not E_S
171089:10	But I think , you know , 0 you have *-1 to look through a place E_S
171089:20	But I think , you know , 0 you have *-1 to look through a place E_S
171097:15	And \[ I think 0 you have , \+ the main thing is that you have \] *-1 to determine that they 're perfectly open . That you 're welcome anytime without notice , in the middle of the day and so forth E_S
171116:29	\[ So . \+ But , \] I really think 0 the news reports \[ are , \+ uh , tend \] *-1 to sensationalize the problems . E_S
171120:8	I think 0 the problems are more ones of cost and resources and , uh , pay and exhaustion and , you know , things like that , rather than these , uh , uh , really wild abuse cases that you read about *T*-1 because it make good copy . E_S
171120:69	I think 0 the problems are more ones of cost and resources and , uh , pay and exhaustion and , you know , things like that , rather than these , uh , uh , really wild abuse cases that you read about *T*-1 because it make good copy . E_S
171135:14	What do you think *T*-1 ? . E_S
171146:13	Uh , I know that , uh , N_S
171157:79	and it 's almost inconceivable now because the Xerox machines \[ and , \+ and \] everything have become \[ \[ such , \+ you know , su- , \] \+ such \] \[ \[ a , \+ a par- , \] \+ a part \] of the way 0 we live *T*-1 . E_S
171177:69	and so if they had business 0 * to do *T*-1 , they had *-2 to finish it , you know , three days in advance so they could get it through the mail . E_S
171181:83	And now it 's the kind of thing where you can work up until the last minute . Because you can get it there , you know \[ in , \+ in \] a matter of minutes you know , through a fax machine *T*-1 E_S
171181:121	And now it 's the kind of thing where you can work up until the last minute . Because you can get it there , you know \[ in , \+ in \] a matter of minutes you know , through a fax machine *T*-1 E_S
171225:13	But I just think 0 \[ our , \+ our \] family lives have changed drastically . E_S
171228:10	And I think 0 that 's ju- , N_S
171230:51	I mean our kids , where would they be *T*-1 without Nintendo and , you know , their T V shows N_S
171232:27	some of that is really bad I think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
171239:10	You know , I 'm wondering what this is going *-1 to do *T*-2 in ten and twenty years . E_S
171242:28	and there 's the fact that , you know , nowadays fewer and fewer couples are deciding *-1 to have kids which *T*-2 generally tends *-3 to happen . E_S
171247:11	You 're probably right . E_S
171251:14	I never really thought about it that way . E_S
171264:104	Well , uh , In terms of the long term \[ effect , \+ effect \] \[ on , \+ on \] America , in terms of the culture and everything , I do n't know . E_S
171266:13	We do n't know that yet . E_S
171268:188	Uh , \[ Most \[ of the , \+ of the \] next generation is going *-1 to be \+ \[ in , \+ \[ or , \+ or \] an , \] \[ \[ ex- , \+ ex- , \] \+ extremely \] large \[ par- , \+ part \] of the next generation is going *-2 to be , \] you know , second generation , \[ f- , \+ uh , from \] immigrant parents . E_S
171271:13	I do n't know either . E_S
171279:15	and I do n't think that America is currently the type of environment where * struggling up from the bottom is necessarily considered *-1 to be good *T*-2 . E_S
171285:35	and not that many people are really trying I do n't think 0 *T*-1 . E_S
171297:20	So . And I do n't know what *T*-1 's going *-2 to happen . E_S
171298:13	Uh , I know 0 what I 'm seeing *T*-1 here at \[ m- , \+ my \] job is that people are having their children much later in life so that they 're establishing careers E_S
171309:11	Well I think 0 the court systems could stand some improvement . E_S
171311:111	but \[ a lot of time i- , \+ a lot of cases , \] uh , * is circumstantial evidence \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 convicts a person , which I do n't think 0 *T*-2 is all the time good . Because sometimes it *EXP*-3 's hard * to get all the facts and to \[ prove a person innocent , \+ I mean prove a person guilty \] if you do n't really know or you do n't really have an eyewitness . E_S
171311:239	but \[ a lot of time i- , \+ a lot of cases , \] uh , * is circumstantial evidence \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 convicts a person , which I do n't think 0 *T*-2 is all the time good .

E_S
171313:13	I do n't know . E_S
171315:10	So you think \[ if , \+ if \] trials were held *-1 by judges or experts , that \[ they , \+ they \] would tend *-2 \[ not to , uh , admit , \+ not to convict \] people on circumstantial evidence ? E_S
171317:8	I think so . E_S
171319:10	You know , \[ I , \+ I \] attended a trial in , uh , Germany when I was a student *T*-1 E_S
171338:8	I think 0 it *EXP*-1 's a lot harder * to get off on technicalities also because \[ they , \+ uh , uh , the judge \] is also sort of a jury ,
171339:22	uh , E_S but I 'm not sure 0 I like that . E_S
171340:8	I think 0 I prefer the jury system myself . E_S
171342:8	You think 0 you prefer the jury ? E_S
171343:8	You think 0 your chances are better ? E_S
171345:21	Uh , well , actually I think 0 in most criminal cases it *EXP*-1 would n't make any difference whether it was a couple of judges or jury . E_S
171352:8	I think 0 that 's really the only thing .
171355:28	well N_S I guess 0 I do n't think that , uh , uh , juries need *-1 to decide sentencing all the time . E_S
171359:8	I think 0 maybe \[ th- , \+ a \] judge is a better judge of that E_S
171359:15	I think 0 maybe \[ th- , \+ a \] judge is a better judge of that E_S
171366:13	I do n't know , E_S
171367:5	maybe I 'm \[ too , \+ too , \] uh , uh , conservative when it comes to that *T*-1 . E_S
171368:47	\[ Th- , \+ the \] sentencing is really light compared to what I think 0 they should be *T*-1 in a lot of cases you know ,
171368:86	\[ Th- , \+ the \] sentencing is really light compared to what I think 0 they should be *T*-1 in a lot of cases you know ,
171375:35	That 's usually a matter of who * to believe *T*-2 and what facts * to believe *T*-1 . E_S
171375:56	That 's usually a matter of who * to believe *T*-2 and what facts * to believe *T*-1 . E_S
171379:177	But people who *T*-4 \[ d- , \+ do n't \] have day in and day out life long experience with what prison is really like *T*-1 and what the options are *T*-2 , * to ask them *-3 to decide for one case , on one person , based on what they see *T*-5 , I think 0 that is maybe , uh , a little bit naive .

E_S
171391:27	But in a lot of places , I think 0 people bend over the other way , E_S
171402:28	But \[ I , \+ I \] do think 0 it needs *-1 to be shaken *-2 up a little bit . E_S
171406:26	But , the thing is too , 0 maybe they need \[ more of a , \+ I do n't know , more of a \] expert types \[ to , \+ to \] be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick , you know , Joe Blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever \[ an- , \+ and \] call them in . E_S

171441:24	So . \[ In , \+ I think , 0 \[ i- , \+ in \] \] criminal trials you need the jury as a defense against the government E_S

171449:8	I believe 0 it was \[ one of these , \+ uh , one of these , \] uh , mixers . \[ These , \+ like these \] juice machines E_S

171458:20	even , despite , you know , diligent washing , \[ it , \+ it \] got rusty after about , uh , three weeks of use . E_S
171459:15	And I do n't think 0 it was my fault because \[ \[ i- , \+ I , \] \+ you know , I \] had made a point of like * drying it off and cleaning it E_S

171461:40	I had *-1 to send it back after like , you know , the third week because I realized 0 \[ it was \+ like , it was \] not , N_S
171462:17	something was very , very wrong with the blade . E_S
171483:32	But \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] probably the worst . E_S
171486:13	I do n't know if you have that up there E_S
171532:18	I said 0 there seems *-1 to be a big attitude problem in that , store E_S

171551:8	They might work on that , you know . E_S

171607:95	Well , we , \[ \[ in , \+ in , \] \+ in \] our family , have been pretty remiss in *-1 trying *-2 to , uh , you know , keep track of , uh , daily finances . E_S
171608:165	Uh , \[ the , \+ \] uh , way back , what , twelve years ago or something when I got my first computer *T*-3 , I did what everybody else does *T*-4 , which *T*-1 is * to put the whole family budget on the machine and put checks , and , you know , checkbooks and all this kind of thing E_S

171616:39	Uh , and I only update that , oh I do n't know , maybe once every quarter or so . Every three months . Just , basically when the statements come in *T*-1 .

171634:30	so , um , I spend most , you know , N_S
171639:68	So \[ it 's a lot , \+ it *EXP*-5 's very hard \] on a nonfixed income because I do n't know how many days I 'm going *-1 to be called *-6 in *T*-2 and whether I am *?* *-3 or not , * to try *-4 to keep track of finances . E_S

171694:10	Oh , sure . E_S
171704:14	But , you know , we do a lot of * robbing Peter *-1 to pay Paul . E_S
171709:23	you 're the first , you know , uh , N_S
171710:48	my next door neighbor just lost his job . In \[ a , \+ you know , one of these , \] uh , N_S

171717:13	I do n't know what a shoe company 's doing *T*-1 *-2 running a computer company . E_S

171736:27	Uh , it sounds like , in a certain sense , at least at the present , N_S
171738:22	but at the present stage , you probably are even more *ICH*-1 in the market for \[ a , \+ a \] budgetary thing \[ than , \+ than \] most people probably \[ ar- , \+ might \] be *?* . In terms of * \[ keeping , \+ keeping \] score of input and output . E_S

171868:33	Well , it 's a good past time , you know . E_S
171873:78	They say , uh , 0 \[ i- , \+ \] football attracts more men because of \[ \[ \[ the , \+ you know , \[ y- , \+ \] the , \] \+ you see the , \] \+ the \] physical aggression on the field E_S
171875:14	and , you know , they get together with a bunch of guys E_S
171886:8	I think that , uh , N_S I personally like hockey better because \[ it has contact , \+ it 's a contact sport . \] E_S
171892:19	and it *EXP*-1 takes a certain skill * to play hockey . E_S
171901:41	I bet up here in New England as well as , you know , \[ in , \+ in \] the Minnesota area N_S

171935:8	I think though that professional football in particular , is becoming so diluted now . E_S

171970:8	I think 0 it 's an , excuse 0 * to do nothing *T*-1 E_S
171979:21	That 's fun , you know . E_S
172023:25	And that 's the thing , you know . E_S
172025:18	You go , you know three or four hours before the game . E_S
172035:35	\[ it , \+ it 's \] not so much , sure the contest itself and the game itself , E_S
172041:43	that you miss *T*-1 *-2 sitting home in your parlor , you know , uh , \[ with , \+ with \] a six pack of beer and some , uh , potato chips , you know E_S
172041:109	that you miss *T*-1 *-2 sitting home in your parlor , you know , uh , \[ with , \+ with \] a six pack of beer and some , uh , potato chips , you know E_S
172050:31	\[ And , \+ and \] any professional sport I think , 0 you miss that . E_S
172056:31	The atmosphere of * being there , you know . E_S
172060:27	and , well , I twirled , you know . E_S
172066:24	And \[ I , \+ you know , I \] did n't , N_S
172067:16	I still do n't know that much about football , obviously . E_S
172068:30	But I still had a good time . You know , E_S
172073:35	and , uh , one of the things 0 I thought about *T*-1 was a lot of the drunk cases that they were having *T*-2 , \[ that , \+ especially for repeat offenders that , \] uh , N_S
172074:5	maybe there should be stiffer penalties for those people who *T*-1 come back again and again . E_S
172075:35	Uh , so that , uh , a judge , I think 0 *T*-3 , would be the most appropriate person 0 *T*-1 \[ to , \+ uh , to \] be able *-2 to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day . E_S
172078:46	\[ I , \+ I \] kind of agree with that , because I think 0 in some cases , uh , the jury may not even have , the information about other crimes 0 the person has committed *T*-1 . E_S
172078:73	\[ I , \+ I \] kind of agree with that , because I think 0 in some cases , uh , the jury may not even have , the information about other crimes 0 the person has committed *T*-1 . E_S
172086:28	Uh , \[ I , \+ I \] think that in some cases that 's considered *-1 to prejudice the current case E_S
172094:33	and if they 're judged *-1 guilty * would probably be in a better \[ pri- , \+ position \] 0 * to give an appropriate , uh , sentencing *T*-2 . E_S
172111:25	that was one thing 0 I thought about *T*-1 that *T*-2 would be really neat if we could do it that way . E_S
172135:68	So I 'm not out for * streamlining things to the point where we , uh , take that , you know , N_S
172138:41	that would require a change in the Bill of Rights , I believe 0 *T*-1 E_S
172149:79	Because , I mean , gee whiz , if I \[ was , \+ \] uh , uh , did n't have that right , you know , * not to have a jury that ,
172154:38	We 're not going *-1 to have a jury , you know , E_S
172156:25	Sort of like car accidents , you know , N_S
172159:11	Well I think 0 that 's all ready possible . E_S
172163:8	I think , that you can waive the right to a , jury trial
172178:11	People should know that that 's an option just in case they feel 0 they have *-1 to have a jury trial . E_S
172179:10	But I think 0 most lawyers do a pretty good job of * making that evident \[ to , \+ to \] clients unless they feel 0 they can , you know , tweak a jury into \[ per- , \+ \] *-1 giving a different sentence or possibly , if it 's a civil case , giving higher , uh , you know , awards of money or something since usually the lawyers get a percentage of \[ the , \+ the \] award .

E_S
172202:48	Well , uh , in the case of , civil , uh , things , I think maybe \[ the , \+ the \] use of the jury is very , often to the lawyer 's advantage E_S

172207:20	and I think 0 that may be where jury use is overdone *-1 *T*-2 , E_S
172210:45	I mean there are cases where they could be settled *-1 , maybe out of court a little more efficiently *T*-2 . E_S
172226:38	so . Uh , I was wondering too , if they were thinking \[ of \+ about \] the judge making awards in civil cases not just sentencing \[ in , \+ in \] a criminal cases . E_S
172233:20	Uh , I 'm not so sure 0 I 'm in favor of that . E_S
172270:10	and it seemed it really , trivial . E_S
172293:30	So \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know if that varies from state to state or if it , N_S
172296:70	and I have really resisted the impulse *-1 to get one for the home . Uh , up until , I guess , maybe about a year and a half ago , E_S
172343:10	Um , sure . E_S
172347:46	So , it provides other means other than just strict , uh , you know , computations and so on , E_S
172374:21	Emil \[ is , \+ probably pulls \] down a third \[ a- , \+ of \] all my time . E_S

172389:16	actually I do n't think 0 I 've ever used a typewriter \[ in , \+ in \] my life *-1 \[ to do \[ a , \+ a \] \+ to do a \] report . Because my family , when I was growing up *T*-2 , we got a basic computer . T R S Eighty when they first came out *T*-3 . E_S
172413:10	and it seems like , N_S
172418:36	\[ \[ It , \+ uh , well , you know , it 's just , \] \+ it was just \] a completely different world then . E_S

172447:40	the old-timers , even the people who *T*-1 are technologists do n't know how *-2 to operate these electronic things like V C R -s and whatnot *T*-3 E_S
172460:13	I do n't know . E_S
172490:52	But , uh , I 'm afraid 0 \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] probably in the minority . E_S
172491:31	\[ I , \+ I \] actually do n't think that we , uh , pay too much in this country . Uh uh , particularly , uh , in this part of the country w- , N_S
172501:8	I think 0 that 's regressive E_S
172505:55	But , on the other hand , I do n't mind that it 's only on , you know , things that *T*-1 are n't like groceries and that , E_S
172523:13	Oh , I think 0 \[ the , \+ the \] sales tax , they just got *-1 to do something about it . E_S
172530:165	But I guess 0 \[ when I hear , \+ when I see \] the comparison between the United States and , uh , any other western country *T*-1 , uh , \[ their , \+ their \] rates are like , uh , forty-one , forty-two and ours are like thirty-six , thirty-seven , you know , E_S
172534:16	Well and I still think that , * having lived in Europe for awhile , you know , difference in living conditions are certainly well worth , uh , what we pay *T*-1 for it . E_S

172543:24	I was in Germany , you know , for several years E_S
172557:10	Uh , probably \[ m- , \+ less \] so *ICH*-1 now than it was *?* ten years ago or whatever E_S
172564:8	I think 0 the other problem is , you know , 0 \[ it , \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] easy * to complain about taxes because there 's something 0 you , theoretically , can do something about *T*-2 . E_S

172584:26	\[ that , \+ that 's \] probably a little tougher on you . E_S
172591:8	I think 0 it 's a dumb decision on our part because countries like Canada and England and Germany do perfectly well with a , uh , two tract system in which religious schools coexist with secular schools \[ f- , \+ with \] the same tax money *T*-1 . E_S
172606:8	I think 0 that 's just you though . E_S
172611:13	\[ I think 0 in places , \+ I think 0 in places \] like California , people are beginning *-1 to find that \[ in , \+ in \] areas that *T*-2 are fairly well off , if you add the , uh , uh , people of various sexual persuasions and those who *T*-3 never intend *-4 to marry and those who *T*-5 are retired and those 0 *T*-6 are , uh , just looking for fun , \[ th- \+ \] people with families turn out *-7 to be such a small minority that they ca n't get a tax bill passed * no matter what *T*-8 happens .

174860:56	and \[ I went through \[ a , \+ a \] pretty , \+ I do n't know , I went through a , standard \] drug testing thing before \[ I , \+ I \] was brought *-1 on . E_S

174889:126	And I guess 0 the only drawback *ICH*-2 0 I can see *T*-1 \[ to , \+ to \] drug testing is \[ in , \+ 0 in \] case you are on some sort of medication that *T*-3 might give some , uh , sort of false positive result then there could be some sort of problem . E_S
174899:38	And \[ that , \+ that \] definitely happens , you know . E_S

174906:38	Another thing is , 0 a lot of times , you know , they are n't that accurate . E_S
174908:44	Like if you 're on a prescription drug of some kind , you know , what are they going *-1 to do *T*-2 about that . E_S
174912:10	You know , I was on a couple of different prescription drugs when I was tested *-1 for Honeywell *T*-2 E_S
174913:24	and , uh , uh , you know , I know 0 they did n't catch that
174913:32	and , uh , uh , you know , I know 0 they did n't catch that
174915:16	Uh , I 'm sure 0 they screen for just a particular few types . E_S
174921:18	Uh , I do n't know . E_S
174947:8	I sure do n't , uh , N_S
174964:8	You probably wondered , huh . E_S
174973:8	I believe from what *ICH*-2 I remember *T*-1 of the literature 0 they gave , uh , if you fail I believe they give you one more chance . E_S
174973:74	I believe from what *ICH*-2 I remember *T*-1 of the literature 0 they gave , uh , if you fail I believe they give you one more chance . E_S
174974:8	They probably give you a chance *-1 to explain yourself and then maybe give you another chance *-2 to go through it . E_S
174974:41	They probably give you a chance *-1 to explain yourself and then maybe give you another chance *-2 to go through it . E_S
174978:19	But , uh , you know , once again , those things are not that accurate E_S
174979:49	so there 's undoubtedly a proportion of people who *T*-1 do fail , you know . E_S
174995:61	That was the first time 0 I 'd ever gotten any kind of drug screening *T*-1 , you know . \[ Was , \+ was \] *-2 going to Honeywell . E_S

175024:13	I do n't know . E_S
175026:74	and while I do n't do any drugs myself , I 've seen some people who *T*-1 work there , uh , you know , smoking a joint or whatever . E_S
175030:19	And , uh , you know , that 's the kind of thing that *T*-1 would definitely come up , you know . E_S
175030:69	And , uh , you know , that 's the kind of thing that *T*-1 would definitely come up , you know . E_S
175036:36	Is it *EXP*-1 formal policy that they said 0 they might test ? E_S
175048:18	Uh , I 'm not sure where *ICH*-2 Georgia ranks *T*-1 in the nation E_S
175053:64	And , uh , there 's a lot of things that I see *T*-1 that *T*-2 are so obviously wrong . That you would think 0 it would be easy 0 * to correct *T*-3 . E_S

175133:27	What do you think 0 *T*-1 's wrong * to cause that ? E_S
175144:13	And that 's certainly is a lot of students 0 for one person to deal with *T*-1 on an every day basis .
175152:27	but more than that , I do n't think that they have the authority * to command the attention of the children . E_S

175472:85	See , \[ wh- , \+ when \] you 're with a big company or a big organization *T*-1 , a lot of times , uh , you know , the benefits are good E_S
175473:28	\[ and , \+ and , \] you know , the pay is regular E_S
175474:19	but , uh , you know , sometimes you do n't get tuned *-2 in to what *T*-1 's going on . E_S
175475:25	And \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 the biggest benefit or the biggest benefit other than wages \[ \[ that , \+ that , \] \+ uh , that \] anybody could get *T*-1 \[ in , \+ in \] * dealing with a large company is * to be in a situation where \[ you , \+ you \] get *-4 to know what *T*-2 's going on *T*-3 .

175480:57	Well , since I 'm kind of on \[ the , \+ the \] older side , you know , \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] just feel like , uh , when I start *-1 talking about benefits *T*-2 , \[ I talk about , \+ I 'm concerned about \] medical benefits . E_S

175487:10	You know , I work for , uh , \[ Wes- , \+ a bank , Western Financial . \] E_S
175491:29	And , uh , they do n't let me know really about anything that *T*-1 's going on . E_S

175499:10	You know , I 'm pretty much on a low level as far as , uh , the company is concerned . E_S
175500:43	But \[ I , \+ I \] do kind of like *-1 to know what *T*-2 's going on and what *T*-3 's happening E_S
175501:10	and I think 0 I can be a better and more effective employee \[ if , \+ if \] I had a little bit more information along that line . E_S
175511:36	\[ And , \+ uh , and so , \] you know , \[ \[ we , \+ we \] do n't , \+ there 's lots of things that we do n't \] get told *-1 *T*-2 . For good reason . E_S

175521:28	And we should have *?* , E_S you know ,
175533:90	and \[ every , \+ all \] the other employees are going *-1 to come around and see what sort of things we do *T*-2 . Which I thought 0 *T*-3 was kind of interesting \[ \[ and , \+ But , \] \+ uh , but \] \[ that , \+ that \] \[ sort , \+ sort \] of thing . N_S
175540:28	But , \[ if you , \+ I think 0 you \] can tolerate a lot of problems if you understand what *T*-1 's going on . E_S
175544:125	\[ \[ And , \+ and , \] \+ but \] of course \[ most time , \+ most of the time \] management has a hard time * distributing or getting the word out to the people who *T*-1 must know . E_S
